    <p class="p" id="concept_aqj_x3c_d5__p_ftk_rrw_25">The Timing Constraints wizard guides you through the process of creating
      timing constraints using the preferred methodology. The wizard analyzes your design for
      missing timing constraints and makes recommendations. It is important to review and understand
      all recommendations made by the Timing Constraints wizard to ensure they are appropriate for
      your design.  </p>

    <p class="p" id="concept_aqj_x3c_d5__p_vyh_qrw_25">The order of pages in the Timing Constraints wizard reflects the various
      dependencies for defining timing constraints. For example, define and constrain clocks first,
      followed by input and output delays, and finally, clock domain crossings.</p>

    <ul class="ul" id="concept_aqj_x3c_d5__ul_ykm_2ms_d5">
      <li class="li">Clocks<ul class="ul" id="concept_aqj_x3c_d5__ul_svw_jms_d5">
          <li class="li"><a class="xref" href="timing_constraints_wizard_primary_clocks_wizard.html">Primary
              Clocks</a>: Primary clocks usually enter the design though input ports. Clock
            definition requires a period,  optionally a name, and a waveform (rising and falling
            edge times) to describe the duty cycle if it is different from the default value of 50%. </li>

          <li class="li"><a class="xref" href="timing_constraints_wizard_generated_clocks_wizard.html">Generated Clocks</a>: Generated clocks are derived from master clocks and are
            located downstream on the clock trees. The Vivado<sup>®</sup> Design Suite
            automatically derives generated clocks for all Clock Modifying Blocks, such as MMCM/PLL,
            dedicated clock buffers with dividers, and UltraScale™ device GT blocks.
            In this section, the wizard identifies missing generated clocks. </li>

          <li class="li"><a class="xref" href="timing_constraints_wizard_forwarded_clocks_wizard.html">Forwarded Clocks</a>: Forwarded clocks are generated clocks defined on output
            ports that replicate internal clocks. A forwarded clock is usually a time reference for
            other output ports to form a source synchronous interface. </li>

          <li class="li"><a class="xref" href="timing_constraints_wizard_external_feedback_delays_wizard.html">External Feedback Delays</a>: External feedback delays are the board
            delays between pairs of device input and output ports which are used in a MMCM or PLL
            feedback loops. Both min and max delay values must be specified. </li>

          <li class="li"><a class="xref" href="timing_constraints_wizard_input_delays_wizard.html">Input
              Delays</a>: Input delay constraints describe the relative phase between reference
            clocks (usually board clocks) and input signals at the boundary of the device. Providing
            inaccurate input delay values can make I/O timing fail and negatively impact the
            implementation quality of results. </li>

          <li class="li"><a class="xref" href="timing_constraints_wizard_output_delays_wizard.html">Output
              Delays</a>: Output delay constraints describe the relative phase between reference
            clocks (usually board clocks or forwarded clocks) and output signals at the boundary of
            the device. Providing inaccurate output delay values can make I/O timing fail and
            negatively impact the implementation quality of results. </li>

          <li class="li"><a class="xref" href="timing_constraints_wizard_combinational_delays_wizard.html">Combinational Constraints</a>: Combinational constraints are timing constraints
            for paths that traverse the  device without being captured by any sequential elements. A
            virtual clock is used to define the reference board clock, and the input/output delay
            constraints describe the delays outside the  device on the combinational paths. </li>

            clocks that do not exist in the design at the same time.</li>

          <li class="li"><a class="xref" href="timing_constraints_wizard_logically_exclusive_clock_groups_with_no_interaction_wizard.html">Logically Exclusive Clocks with No Interaction</a>: Logically
            exclusive clocks are active at the same time in the design except on shared clock tree
            sections, such as after a clock multiplexer. When these clocks do not have logical paths
            between each other outside the share sections, they are logically exclusive with no
            interaction. </li>

          <li class="li"><a class="xref" href="timing_constraints_wizard_logically_exclusive_clock_groups_with_interaction_wizard.html">Logically Exclusive Clocks with Interaction</a>: Logically exclusive
            clocks are active at the same time in the design except on shared clock tree sections,
            such as after a clock multiplexer. When these clocks have logical paths between each
            other outside the shared sections or with the shared sections, only the clocks limited
            to the shared clock tree sections are logically exclusive. </li>

          <li class="li"><a class="xref" href="timing_constraints_wizard_asynchronous_clock_domain_crossings_wizard.html">Asynchronous Clock Domain Crossings</a>: Asynchronous clock domain
            crossings occur when data are transferred between two clocks that do not have a known
            phase relationship and consequently, cannot be safely reported by static timing
            analysis. Usually, for these crossings to be functionally safe, a synchronizer must be
            present with the ASYNC_REG property set to true. The dialog box shows the asynchronous
            clock pairs that are not already covered by clock groups or <a class="xref" href="http://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/rdoc?v=replace;d=ug835-vivado-tcl-commands.pdf;a=xset_false_path" target="_blank">set_false_path</a> or <a class="xref" href="http://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/rdoc?v=replace;d=ug835-vivado-tcl-commands.pdf;a=xset_max_delay" target="_blank">set_max_delay</a> -datapath_only constraints. </li>
