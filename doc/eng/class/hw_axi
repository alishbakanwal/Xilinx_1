HW_AXI

Description: 
The JTAG to AXI Master core, or hw_axi object, is a customizable IP core that 
works as an AXI Master to drive AXI transactions and drive AXI signals on the 
Xilinx FPGA device, hw_device object. The AXI Master core supports AXI4 interfaces 
and AXI-Lite protocol. The width of AXI data bus is configurable. The AXI core 
can drive AXI4-Lite or AXI4 Memory mapped Slave through an AXI4 interconnect. The 
core can also be connected to interconnect as the master.

The JTAG to AXI Master core must be instantiated in the RTL code, from the Xilinx 
IP catalog. Detailed documentation on the AXI core can be found in the LogiCORE IP 
JTAG to AXI Master Product Guide (PG174). 

Related Objects:
The AXI Master cores can be added to a design in the RTL source files from the 
Xilinx IP catalog. AXI cores can be found in the synthesized netlist design using 
the get_debug_cores command. These are not the hardware AXI Master core objects, 
hw_axi, found in the Hardware Manager feature of the Vivado Design Suite, though 
they are related. 

The HW_AXI core can be found in the Hardware Manager on the programmed hardware 
device object, hw_device. You can query the hw_axi of the hw_device as follows:

	get_hw_axis -of [get_hw_devices]

In addition, the HW_AXI core has AXI transactions associated with the core that can 
be queried as follows:

	get_hw_axi_txns -of [get_hw_axis]

Properties:
You can use the report_property command to report the properties assigned to a 
HW_AXI core. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite Tcl Command Reference (UG835) for 
more information. The properties assigned to HW_AXI objects include the following, 
with examples:  

Property               Type    Read-only  Visible  Value
CLASS                  string  true       true     hw_axi
HW_CORE                string  true       false    core_8
NAME                   string  true       true     hw_axi_1
PROTOCOL               string  true       true     AXI4_Full
STATUS.AXI_READ_BUSY   bool    true       true     0
STATUS.AXI_READ_DONE   bool    true       true     0
STATUS.AXI_WRITE_BUSY  bool    true       true     0
STATUS.AXI_WRITE_DONE  bool    true       true     0
STATUS.BRESP           string  true       true     OKAY
STATUS.RRESP           string  true       true     OKAY

To report the properties for a specific HW_AXI, you can copy and paste the following command 
into the Vivado Design Suite Tcl shell or Tcl console:

	report_property -all [lindex [get_hw_axis] 0]
