HW_PROBE

Description: 
A hardware probe object, hw_probe, provides access to signals in the design to 
monitor and drive signal values, and track hardware events on the FPGA device. 
Hardware probes can be added to both ILA and VIO debug cores. 

Debug probes can be added to ILA debug cores in the RTL design source, along with 
the core, or in the synthesized netlist design using the create_debug_probe 
command, and connected to signals in the design using connect_debug_probe. 

Probes can only be added to VIO debug cores in the RTL design when the IP core is 
customized, or re-customized, from the IP catalog, and signals connected to it. 
Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Vivado Programming and Debugging 
(UG908) for more information on adding ILA and VIO debug cores and signal probes 
to the design.

Debug cores and probes are written to a probes file (.ltx) with write_debug_probes, 
and associated with the hardware device,  along with the bitstream file (.bit), 
using the PROBES.FILE and PROGRAM.FILE properties of the hw_device object. The 
hardware device is programmed with this information using the program_hw_device 
command.

Related Objects:
The hardware probe objects are associated with the ILA and VIO debug cores 
programmed onto the hardware devices on the open hardware target. You can query 
the hw_probe objects associated with these debug core objects:

	get_hw_probes -of [get_hw_ilas hw_ila_2]
	get_hw_probes -of [get_hw_vios]

Properties:
There are three types of debug probes: ILA, VIO_INPUT, and VIO_OUTPUT. The 
properties assigned to a hw_probe object depend on the type of probe. You can use 
the report_property command to report the properties assigned to a hw_probe 
object. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite Tcl Command Reference (UG835) for more 
information. The properties assigned to an ILA type hw_probe object incudes the 
following, with example values:  

Property               Type    Read-only  Visible  Value
CAPTURE_COMPARE_VALUE  string  false      true     eq2'hX
CLASS                  string  true       true     hw_probe
COMPARATOR_COUNT       int     true       true     4

PROBE_PORT_BITS        int     true       true     0
PROBE_PORT_BIT_COUNT   int     true       true     2
TRIGGER_COMPARE_VALUE  string  false      true     eq2'hX
TYPE                   string  true       true     ila

To report the properties for a specific type of hw_probe object, you can copy and 
paste one of the following commands into the Vivado Design Suite Tcl shell or Tcl 
console:

	report_property -all [lindex [get_hw_probes -filter {TYPE == ila}] 0]
	report_property -all [lindex [get_hw_probes -filter {TYPE == vio_input}] 0]
	report_property -all [lindex [get_hw_probes -filter {TYPE == vio_output}] 0]
