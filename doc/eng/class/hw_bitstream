HW_BITSTREAM

Description: 
A hardware bitstream object hw_bitstream, that is created from a bitstream file, 
to associate with a hardware device object, hw_device, in the Hardware Manager 
feature of the Vivado Design Suite.

The bitstream file is created from a placed and routed design with the 
write_bitstream command. The hardware bitstream object is created manually from 
a bitstream file with the create_hw_bitstream command, or automatically created 
when the hardware device is programmed with the program_hw_device command. 

The hw_bitstream object is associated with the specified hw_device through the 
PROGRAM.HW_BITSTREAM property on the device. This property is automatically set by 
the create_hw_bitstream command. The PROGRAM.FILE property includes the file path 
of the specified bitstream file. 

Related Objects:
The hw_bitstream object is associated with a hardware_device, through the 
PROGRAM.BITSTREAM property. You can query the hw_bitstream object using the
get_property command to return the object in the property as follows:

	get_property PROGRAM.HW_BITSTREAM [current_hw_device]

Properties:
You can use the report_property command to report the properties assigned to a 
hardware bitstream object. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite Tcl Command Reference 
(UG835) for more information. The specific properties of the hw_bitsream object 
include the following, with example values: 

Property  Type    Read-only  Visible  Value
CLASS     string  true       true     hw_bitstream
DESIGN    string  true       true     ks_counter2
DEVICE    string  true       true     xc7k325t
NAME      string  true       true     C:/Data/ks_counter2_k7/project_1/project_1.runs/impl_1/ks_counter2.bit
PART      string  true       true     xc7k325tffg900-3
SIZE      string  true       true     11443612
USERCODE  string  true       true     0XFFFFFFFF

To report the properties for a hw_bitstream object, you can use the get_property 
command to return the object defined in the PROGRAM.HW_BITSTREAM property on a 
hw_device in the Vivado logic analyzer. You can copy and paste the following command 
into the Vivado Design Suite Tcl shell or Tcl console:

	report_property -all [get_property PROGRAM.HW_BITSTREAM [current_hw_device]]
