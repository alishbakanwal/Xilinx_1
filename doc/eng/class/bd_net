BD_NET

Description: 
A block design net, or a bd_net object, connects the pins on an IP Integrator 
block design cell to other pins, or to external ports. The bd_net object connects 
through multiple levels of the design hierarchy, connecting block design cells. 
Every net has a name which identifies it in the design. All block design cells, 
pins, and ports connected to these nets are electrically connected.

Related Objects:
The block design net, bd_net object, occurs in a block design, or diagram. It is 
connected to ports (bd_port), and through pins (bd_pin) to block design cells 
(bd_cell) in the diagram. You can query the bd_nets of the diagram, bd_cell, 
bd_pin, and bd_port objects. 

	get_bd_nets -of_objects [get_bd_ports]

In addition, you can query the bd_cells, or the bd_pins, or bd_port objects that 
are connected to a specific bd_net:

	get_bd_cells -of_objects [get_bd_nets clk_wiz*]

Properties:
The properties on the bd_net object include the following:

Property  Type    Read-only  Visible  Value
CLASS     string  true       true     bd_net
NAME      string  false      true     clk_wiz_1_locked
PATH      string  true       true     /clk_wiz_1_locked

To report the properties for the bd_net object, you can copy and paste the 
following command into the Vivado Design Suite Tcl shell or Tcl console:

	report_property -all [lindex [get_bd_nets] 0]
