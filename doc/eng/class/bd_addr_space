BD_ADDR_SPACE

Description: 
An address space, or bd_addr_space object, is an assigned logically addressable 
space of memory on a master interface, or on AXI interface ports connected to an 
AXI master external to the block design. 

The IP integrator feature of the Vivado Design Suite follows the industry 
standard IP-XACT data format for capturing memory requirements and capabilities. 
Some blocks may have one address space associated with multiple master 
interfaces, for example a processor with a system bus and fast memory bus. 
Other components may have multiple address spaces associated with multiple 
master interfaces, one for instruction and the other for data.

Master interfaces reference address spaces, or bd_addr_space objects. When an AXI 
slave is mapped to a master address space, a master address segment (bd_addr_seg) 
object is created, mapping the address segments of the slave to the master. 

Related Objects:
The master address segment, bd_addr_seg, is associated with the address spaces 
in AXI master interfaces, found on a block design. The address space is referenced 
by the interface pins, bd_intf_pin, on the cell, bd_cell. External AXI masters are
associated with interface ports, bd_intf_port. 

You can query the bd_addr_space objects of these associated objects:

get_bd_addr_spaces -of_objects [get_bd_cells /microblaze_0]
get_bd_addr_segs -of_objects [get_bd_addr_spaces -of_objects [get_bd_cells /microblaze_0]]

You can also query the objects associated with the block design address spaces:

get_bd_intf_pins -of_objects [get_bd_addr_spaces *SLMB]

Properties:
The properties on a block design address space object, bd_addr_space, include the 
following, with example values:

Property  Type    Read-only  Visible  Value
CLASS     string  true       true     bd_addr_space
NAME      string  false      true     S_AXI_CTRL
OFFSET    string  false      true     
PATH      string  true       true     /microblaze_0_local_memory/dlmb_bram_if_cntlr/S_AXI_CTRL
RANGE     string  false      true     4096
TYPE      string  false      true     

To report the properties for a bd_addr_space object, you can copy and paste the 
following command into the Vivado Design Suite Tcl shell or Tcl console:

	report_property -all [lindex [get_bd_addr_spaces] 0]
