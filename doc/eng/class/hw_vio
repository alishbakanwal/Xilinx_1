HW_VIO

Description: 
The Virtual Input/Output (VIO) debug core, hw_vio, can both monitor and drive 
internal signals on a programmed Xilinx FPGA device in real time. In the absence 
of physical access to the target hardware, you can use this debug feature to 
drive and monitor signals that are present on the physical device.

The VIO core has hardware probes, hw_probe objects, to monitor and drive specific 
signals on the design. Input probes monitor signals as inputs to the VIO core. 
Output probes drive  signals to specified values from the VIO core. Values on the 
probe are defined using the set_property command, and are driven onto the signals 
at the probe using the commit_hw_vio command. 

The VIO debug core must be instantiated in the RTL code, from the Xilinx IP catalog. 
Therefore  you need to know  what nets you want monitor and drive prior to debugging 
the design. The IP Catalog provides the VIO core under the Debug category. Detailed 
documentation on the VIO core can be found in the LogiCORE IP Virtual Input/Output 
Product Guide (PG159). 

Related Objects:
VIO debug cores can be added to a design in the RTL source files from the Xilinx 
IP catalog. Debug cores can be found in the synthesized netlist design using the 
get_debug_cores command. These are not the hardware VIO debug core objects, hw_vio, 
found in the Hardware Manager feature of the Vivado Design Suite, though they are 
related. 

The hardware VIO debug core can be found in the Hardware Manager on the programmed 
hardware device object, hw_device. You can query the hw_vio of the hw_device as 
follows:

	get_hw_vios -of [current_hw_device]

In addition, the hw_vio debug core has probes associated with it, that can also be
queried:

	get_hw_probes -of [get_hw_vios]

Properties:
You can use the report_property command to report the properties assigned to a 
HW_VIO object. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite Tcl Command Reference (UG835) for 
more information.

To report the properties for a HW_VIO object, you can copy and paste the 
following command into the Vivado Design Suite Tcl shell or Tcl console:

	report_property -all [lindex [get_hw_vios] 0]
