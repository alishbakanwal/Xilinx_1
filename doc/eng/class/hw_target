HW_TARGET

Description: 
The hardware target, hw_target, is a system board containing a JTAG chain of one 
or more Xilinx devices that you can program with a bitstream file, or use to 
debug your design. Connections between hardware targets on the system board and 
the Vivado Design Suite are managed by a hardware server object, hw_server. 

Use the open_hw_target command to open a connection to one of the available 
hardware targets. The open target is automatically defined as the current hardware 
target. The Vivado logic analyzer directs programming and debug commands to device 
objects, hw_device, on the open target through the hw_server connection.

You can also open the hw_target using the -jtag_mode option of the open_hw_target 
command, to put the target into JTAG test mode to access the Instuction Register 
(IR) and Data Registers (DR) of the device or devices on the target. When the target 
is opened in JTAG mode, a hw_jtag object is created in the Hardware Manager feature 
of the Vivado Design Suite, providing access to the JTAG TAP controller. 

Refer to Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Programming and Debugging (UG908) for a 
list of supported JTAG download cables and devices. 

Related Objects:
Hardware targets are associated with hardware servers, and can be queried as objects 
of the hw_server object:

	get_hw_target -of [get_hw_servers] 

In addition, you can query the hardware devices associated with a hardware target:

	get_hw_devices -of [current_hw_target]

When the target is opened in JTAG mode you can access the hw_jtag object created 
through the HW_JTAG property on the target:

get_property HW_JTAG [current_hw_target]

Properties:
You can use the report_property command to report the properties assigned to a hw_target 
object. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite Tcl Command Reference (UG835) for more 
information. The properties assigned to the hw_target object include the following, 
with example values:

Property         Type     Read-only  Visible  Value
CLASS            string   true       true     hw_target
DEVICE_COUNT     int      true       true     1
HW_JTAG          hw_jtag  true       true     
IS_OPENED        bool     true       true     1
NAME             string   true       true     localhost/xilinx_tcf/Digilent/210203327463A
PARAM.DEVICE     string   true       true     jsn-JTAG-SMT1-210203327463A
PARAM.FREQUENCY  enum     true       true     15000000
PARAM.TYPE       string   true       true     xilinx_tcf
TID              string   true       true     jsn-JTAG-SMT1-210203327463A
UID              string   true       true     Digilent/210203327463A

To report the properties for a hw_target, you can copy and paste the following command 
into the Vivado Design Suite Tcl shell or Tcl console:

	report_property -all [get_hw_targets]
