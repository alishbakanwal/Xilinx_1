BD_INTF_PORT

Description: 
An interface is a grouping of signals that share a common function, containing 
both individual signals and multiple buses. An AXI4-Lite master, for example, 
contains a large number of individual signals plus multiple buses, which are all 
required to make a connection. By grouping these signals and buses into an 
interface, the Vivado IP integrator can identify common interfaces and 
automatically make multiple connections in a single step. 

An interface is defined using the IP-XACT standard. Standard interfaces provided 
by Xilinx can be found in the Vivado installation directory at data/ip/interfaces. 
See the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Designing IP Subsystems Using IP Integrator
(UG994) for more information on interface nets, pins, and ports. 

A block design interface port is a special type of hierarchical pin, a pin on the 
top-level of the block diagram. In block designs, ports and interface are primary 
ports communicating the external connection of the block design or diagram from or 
to the overall FPGA design, or system level design. 

Related Objects:
The block design interface port, bd_intf_port object, occurs in a block design, or 
diagram. It is connected by block design interface nets (bd_intf_net) to the pins 
of block design cells (bd_cell). You can query the bd_intf_ports of the diagram, or 
those connected to block design interface nets. 

	get_bd_intf_ports -of_objects [get_bd_intf_nets]

You can also query the interface nets connected to bd_intf_port objects:

	get_bd_intf_nets -of_objects [get_bd_intf_ports CLK*]

Properties:
The specific properties on a block design interface port object can vary depending 
on the type of the port. The following table lists some of the properties assigned 
to a clock bd_intf_port object, with example values:

Property        Type    Read-only  Visible  Value
CLASS           string  true       true     bd_intf_port
CONFIG.FREQ_HZ  string  false      true     100000000
LOCATION        string  false      true     130 460
MODE            string  true       true     Slave
NAME            string  false      true     CLK_IN1_D
PATH            string  true       true     /CLK_IN1_D
VLNV            string  true       true     xilinx.com:interface:diff_clock_rtl:1.0

To report the properties for a bd_intf_port object, you can copy and paste the 
following command into the Vivado Design Suite Tcl shell or Tcl console:

	report_property -all [lindex [get_bd_ports] 0]
