BD_PORT

Description: 
A block design port is a special type of hierarchical pin, a pin on the top-level 
diagram. In block designs, the ports are primary ports communicating the external 
connection of the block design or diagram to the overall FPGA design, or system
level design. 

Related Objects:
The block design port, bd_port object, occurs in a block design, or diagram. It is 
connected by block design nets (bd_net) to the pins (bd_pin) of block design cells 
(bd_cell) in the diagram. You can query the bd_ports of the diagram, or those 
connected to block design nets. 

	get_bd_ports -of_objects [get_bd_nets]

You can also query the block design nets connected to bd_port objects:

	get_bd_nets -of_objects [get_bd_ports aux_reset_in]

Properties:
The specific properties on a block design port object can vary depending on the 
type of the port. The following table lists some of the properties assigned to a 
RESET type bd_port object in the Vivado Design Suite, with example values:

Property         Type    Read-only  Visible  Value
CLASS            string  true       true     bd_port
CONFIG.POLARITY  string  false      true     ACTIVE_LOW
DIR              string  true       true     I
INTF             string  true       true     FALSE
LEFT             string  false      true     
LOCATION         string  false      true     130 560
NAME             string  false      true     aux_reset_in
PATH             string  true       true     /aux_reset_in
RIGHT            string  false      true     
TYPE             string  true       true     rst

To report the properties for a bd_port object, you can copy and paste the 
following command into the Vivado Design Suite Tcl shell or Tcl console:

	report_property -all [lindex [get_bd_ports] 0]
