HW_SIO_GTGROUP

Description: 
GT groups relate to the GT IO Banks on the hardware device, with the number of 
available GT pins and banks determined by the target Xilinx FPGA. On the Kintex-7 
xc7k325 part, for example, there are four GT groups, each containing four 
differential GT pin pairs. Each GT pin has its own receiver, hw_sio_rx, and 
transmitter, hw_sio_tx. GT groups can also include one shared PLL per quad, or 
Quad PLL. The GT groups are defined on  the IBERT debug core, and can be customized 
with a number of user settings when the IBERT is added into the RTL design. Refer 
to the LogiCORE IP Integrated Bit Error Ratio Tester (IBERT) for 7 Series GTX 
Transceivers v3.0 (PG132) for more information. 

Related Objects:
GT Groups are associated with  hw_server, hw_target, hw_device, hw_sio_ibert, 
hw_sio_gt, hw_sio_common, hw_sio_pll, hw_sio_tx, hw_sio_rx, and hw_sio_link 
objects. 

You can query the GT groups associated with these objects:

	get_hw_sio_gtgroups -of [get_hw_sio_gts *MGT_X0Y9]

Properties:
You can use the report_property command to report the properties of a 
HW_SIO_GTGROUP. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite Tcl Command Reference (UG835) for 
more information. The properties on the hw_sio_gtgroup object include the
following, with example values:  

Property      Type    Read-only  Visible  Value
CLASS         string  true       true     hw_sio_gtgroup
DISPLAY_NAME  string  true       true     Quad_117
GT_TYPE       string  true       true     7 Series GTX
NAME          string  true       true     localhost/xilinx_tcf/Digilent/210203327463A/0_1/IBERT/Quad_117
PARENT        string  true       true     localhost/xilinx_tcf/Digilent/210203327463A/0_1/IBERT

To report the properties for a specific HW_SIO_GTGROUP, you can copy and paste the 
following command into the Vivado Design Suite Tcl shell or Tcl console:

	report_property -all [lindex [get_hw_sio_gtgroups] 0]
