Description:

  Open an Hardware design in the tool. The Hardware design must previously have been exported using the Vivado product. Users can open multiple hardware designs at same time.

  This command returns a Hardware design object of the opened Hardware 
  design, or returns an error if the command fails.

  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - The path and file name of the Hardware design to open in the
  tool. The name must include the file extension.
