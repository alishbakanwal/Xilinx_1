Description:

  This command lets you configure the messages returned by the HSM tool in
  the current session. Use this command to change the severity of messages,
  to limit the number of times a message is reported, or to suppress the
  message altogether. However, you can only perform one of these actions at
  one time with set_msg_config:

   *  Customize the severity of messages returned by the tool to specific
      levels appropriate to your usage. For instance, set the severity of a
      specified message ID from one type, such as WARNING, to another type,
      such as ERROR.

   *  Define the number of messages that will be returned by the tool during
      a design session, or single invocation. You can specify the limit of a
      specific message ID, or the limit for a specific severity of messages.

   *  Suppress a specific message ID from being reported by the tool at all.
      You can enable messages that were previously suppressed using the
      reset_msg_config command.

   *  An error is returned if more than one action is attempted in a single
      set_msg_config command.

  Message qualifiers of string, ID, and severity are used to determine which
  messages are configured by the set_msg_config command. You must supply at
  least one message qualifier to identify a message or group of messages to
  apply the command to. Multiple qualifiers have an AND relationship; the
  configuration rule will be applied only to messages matching all
  qualifiers.

  Note: set_msg_config does not support the use of wildcards in message
  qualifiers

  Message configuration rules are project specific, and are persistent with
  the project when the project is closed and reopened. Use the get_msg_config
  command to report the current configuration of a specific message, or the
  configuration rules defined in the current project.

  Restore messages to their default configurations using the reset_msg_config
  command.

  Note: The default message limit for all message IDs is set to 100, and is
  defined by the parameter messaging.defaultLimit. This is the limit applied
  to each separate message returned by the tool. You can report the current
  value of this parameter with the get_param command, and change it as needed
  using the set_param command.


Arguments:

  -id <arg> - (Optional) Specify the message ID to configure. Every message
  delivered by the tool has a unique global message ID that consists of an
  application sub-system code and a message identifier. This results in a
  message ID that looks like the following:

    "HSM 17-54"

  -string <args> - (Optional) Apply the selected operation only to messages
  that contain the given list of strings. Strings must be enclosed in braces,
  and multiple strings can be specified separated by spaces:

    {{HSM} {All Programmable}}

  Note: Strings are case sensitive.

  -severity - (Required) The severity of the message. There are five message
  severities:

   *  ERROR - An ERROR condition implies an issue has been encountered which
      will render design results unusable and cannot be resolved without user
      intervention.

   *  {CRITICAL WARNING} - A CRITICAL WARNING message indicates that certain
      input/constraints will either not be applied or are outside the best
      practices for a FPGA family. User action is strongly recommended.

      Note: Since this is a two word value, it must be enclosed in {} or "".

   *  WARNING - A WARNING message indicates that design results may be
      sub-optimal because constraints or specifications may not be applied as
      intended. User action may be taken or may be reserved.

   *  INFO - An INFO message is the same as a STATUS message, but includes a
      severity and message ID tag. An INFO message includes a message ID to
      allow further investigation through answer records if needed.

   *  STATUS - A STATUS message communicates general status of the process
      and feedback to the user regarding design processing. A STATUS message
      does not include a message ID.

      Note: Because STATUS messages do not have message IDs, you cannot
      change the severity level of a STATUS message.


  -limit <arg> - (Optional) The message limit specified as an integer value
  >= 1. You can restore the message limit to the messaging.defaultLimit by
  specifying a count of -1.

  -new_severity <arg> - (Optional) For the messages that match the qualifier,
  specify a new message severity. Valid values are defined above under the
  -severity option.

  -suppress - (Optional) Suppress the specified messages from further
  reporting.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.


Examples:

  The following example elevates a common INFO message to a Critical Warning:

    set_msg_config -id "HSM 1-7" -new_severity "CRITICAL WARNING"

  The following example suppresses messages with the specified message ID:

    set_msg_config -suppress -id {HSM 9-10}

  The following example results in warning messages with message ID "17-35",
  and containing "clk" in the message, being redefined as Error messages:

    set_msg_config -severity warning -string "clk" -id "17-35" -new_severity error

  The following example gets the current default message limit, specifies a
  new default value, then defines a different message limit for the specified
  message id:

    get_param messaging.defaultLimit
       100
    set_param messaging.defaultLimit 1000
    set_msg_config -id "common 17-81" -limit 1500
