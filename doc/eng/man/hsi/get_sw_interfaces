Description:

  Specifies the interfaces implemented by the library or driver and 
  describes the interface functions and header files used by the library or driver.

Arguments:

  -regexp - (Optional) Specifies that the search <patterns> are written as
  regular expressions. Both search <patterns> and -filter expressions must be
  written as regular expressions when this argument is used. Xilinx regular
  expression Tcl commands are always anchored to the start of the search
  string. You can add ".*" to the beginning or end of a search string to
  widen the search to include a substring. See
  http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/re_syntax.htm for help with regular
  expression syntax.

  Note: The Tcl built-in command regexp is not anchored, and works as a
  standard Tcl command. For more information refer to
  http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/regexp.htm.

  -filter <args> - (Optional) Filter the results list with the specified
  expression. The -filter argument filters the list of objects returned by
  get_sw_interfaces based on property values on the software interfaces. You can find the
  properties on an object with the report_property or list_property commands.
  In the case of the sw_interface object, "NAME", and "other config parameters"
  are some of the properties that can be used to filter results.

  The filter search pattern should be quoted to avoid having to escape
  special characters that may be found in net, pin, or cell names, or other
  properties. String matching is case-sensitive and is always anchored to the
  start and to the end of the search string. The wildcard "*" character can
  be used at the beginning or at the end of a search string to widen the
  search to include a substring of the property value.

  Note: The filter returns an object if a specified property exists on the
  object, and the specified pattern matches the property value on the object.
  In the case of the "*" wildcard character, this will match a property with
  a defined value of ""

  For string comparison, the specific operators that can be used in filter
  expressions are "equal" (==), "not-equal" (!=), "match" (=~), and
  "not-match" (!~). Numeric comparison operators <, >, <=, and >= can also be
  used. Multiple filter expressions can be joined by AND and OR (&& and ||).

  -of_objects <arg> - (Optional) Get the software interfaces that are available in OS, 
  Drivers, Libraries, Processor, Core, as returned by the get_os, get_drivers, 
  get_libs, get_sw_processor, get_sw_cores  commands.

  Note: The -of_objects option requires objects to be specified using the get_* commands, 
  such as get_os or get_libs, rather than specifying objects by name. 
  In addition, -of_objects cannot be used with a search <pattern>

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <patterns> - (Optional) Match software interfaces against the specified
  patterns. The default pattern is the wildcard `*` which gets a list of all
  software interfaces. More than one pattern can be
  specified to find multiple software interfaces based on different search criteria.

  Note: You must enclose multiple search patterns in braces {} to present the
  list as a single element.


Examples:

  The following example gets a list of software interfaces present in all software cores(drivers/libs/os)

    get_sw_interfaces

  The following example gets a list of all software interfaces matching the name "stdout"

    get_sw_interfaces stdout

  The following example gets a list of software interfaces present in OS of current software design.

    get_sw_interfaces -of_objects [get_os]
