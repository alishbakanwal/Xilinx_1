Description:

  Gets the property name, property type, and property value for all of the
  properties on a specified object, or class of objects.

  Note: list_property also returns a list of all properties on an object, but
  does not include the property type or value.

  You can specify objects for report_property using the get_* series of
  commands to get a specific object. You can use the lindex command to return
  a specific object from a list of objects:

    report_property [lindex [get_cells] 0]

  However, if you are looking for the properties on a class of objects, you
  should use the -classoption instead of an actual object.

  This command returns a report of properties on the object, or returns an
  error if it fails.


Arguments:

  -all - (Optional) Return all of the properties for an object, even if the
  property value is not currently defined.

  -class <arg> - (Optional) Return the properties of the specified class
  instead of a specific object. The class argument is case sensitive, and
  most class names are lower case.

  Note: -class cannot be used together with an <object>

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string. The Tcl
  string can be captured by a variable definition and parsed or otherwise
  processed.

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file. The
  specified file will be overwritten if one already exists, unless -append is
  also specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option

  -regexp - (Optional) Specifies that the search <pattern> is written as a
  regular expression.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <object> - (Optional) A single object on which to report properties.

  Note: If you specify multiple objects you will get an error.

  <pattern> - (Optional) Match the available properties on the <object> or
  -class against the specified search pattern. The <pattern> applies to the
  property name, and only properties matching the specified pattern will be
  reported. The default pattern is the wildcard `*` which returns a list of
  all properties on the specified object.

  Note: The search pattern is case sensitive, and most properties are UPPER
  case.


Examples:

  The following example returns all properties of the specified object:

    report_property -all [get_cells microblaze_0]

  To determine which properties are available for the different design
  objects supported by the tool, you can use multiple report_property
  commands in sequence. The following example returns all properties of the
  specified current objects:

    report_property -all [current_hw_design]
    report_property -all [current_sw_design]
