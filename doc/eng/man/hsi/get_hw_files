Description:

  Gets a list of hardware handoff files in the current hardware session.

Arguments:

  -regexp - (Optional) Specifies that the search <patterns> are written as
  regular expressions. Both search <patterns> and -filter expressions must be
  written as regular expressions when this argument is used. Xilinx regular
  expression Tcl commands are always anchored to the start of the search
  string. You can add ".*" to the beginning or end of a search string to
  widen the search to include a substring. See
  http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/re_syntax.htm for help with regular
  expression syntax.

  Note: The Tcl built-in command regexp is not anchored, and works as a
  standard Tcl command. For more information refer to
  http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/regexp.htm.

  -filter <args> - (Optional) Filter the results list with the specified
  expression. The -filter argument filters the list of objects returned by
  get_files based on property values on the files. You can find the
  properties on an object with the report_property or list_property commands.
  Any property/value pair can be used as a filter. In the case of the "file"
  object, "TYPE" is the property that can be used to filter results.
  
  -of_objects <args> - (Optional) Get the files that are associated with the
  specified hardware design. The default is to search all hardware designs opened. 

  Note: The -of_objects option requires objects to be specified using the
  get_* commands, such as get_hw_designs,current_hw_design, rather than specifying
  objects by name. In addition, -of_objects cannot be used with a search
  <pattern>
 
  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <patterns> - (Optional) Match files against the specified patterns. The
  default pattern is the wildcard `*` which gets all files in the project or
  of_objects. More than one pattern can be specified to find multiple files
  based on different search criteria.


Examples:

  The following example returns the bit files in the design that are used for
  programming FPGA :

    get_files -filter {TYPE == bit}
