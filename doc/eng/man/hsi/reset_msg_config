Description:

  This command restores the default settings of the message limits or
  severity for messages returned by the Vivado tool, or can unsuppress
  previously suppressed messages, as configured by the set_msg_config
  command.

  You can only perform one reset action for each reset_msg_config command. An
  error is returned if more than one action is attempted in a single
  reset_msg_config command.

  Message qualifiers of string, ID, and severity are used to determine which
  messages are reset by the reset_msg_config command. Multiple qualifiers
  have an AND relationship; the configuration rule will be applied only to
  messages matching all qualifiers.

  Note: You must supply at least one message qualifier to identify a message
  or group of messages to apply the command to, or an error is returned.

  To report the current rule configurations for messages, use the
  get_msg_config command.


Arguments:

  -string <args> - (Optional) Apply the selected operation only to messages
  that contain the given list of strings. Strings must be enclosed in braces,
  and multiple strings can be specified separated by spaces:

    {{Vivado} {All Programmable}}

  Note: Strings are case sensitive.

  -id <arg> - (Optional) Reset messages matching the specified message ID.
  The message ID is included in all returned messages. For example, "Common
  17-54" and "Netlist 29-28".

  Note: A wildcard * indicates all message IDs should be reset

  -severity <arg> - Reset messages with the specified message severity. There
  are five message severities:

   *  ERROR - An ERROR condition implies an issue has been encountered which
      will render design results unusable and cannot be resolved without user
      intervention.

   *  {CRITICAL WARNING} - A CRITICAL WARNING message indicates that certain
      input/constraints will either not be applied or are outside the best
      practices for a FPGA family. User action is strongly recommended.

      Note: Since this is a two word value, it must be enclosed in {}.

   *  WARNING - A WARNING message indicates that design results may be
      sub-optimal because constraints or specifications may not be applied as
      intended. User action may be taken or may be reserved.

   *  INFO - An INFO message is the same as a STATUS message, but includes a
      severity and message ID tag. An INFO message includes a message ID to
      allow further investigation through answer records if needed.

   *  STATUS - A STATUS message communicates general status of the process
      and feedback to the user regarding design processing. A STATUS message
      does not include a message ID.

  -limit - (Optional) Reset the message limit for messages matching the
  string, ID, or severity qualifiers.

  -suppress - (Optional) Reset, or unsuppress messages matching the string,
  ID, or severity qualifiers.

  -count - (Optional) Reset the message count for messages matching the
  string, ID, or severity qualifiers.

  -default_severity - (Optional) Restore the default message severity for
  messages matching the string, ID, or severity qualifiers.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.


Examples:

  The following example changes the severity of the specified message ID to a
  Critical Warning, and then resets the message to its default severity:

    set_msg_config -id "Common 17-81" -new_severity "CRITICAL WARNING"
    reset_msg_config -id "Common 17-81" -default_severity

  The following example suppresses the specified message ID using
  set_msg_config, and then un-suppresses it using reset_msg_config:

    set_msg_config -id {HDL 9-1654} -suppress
    reset_msg_config -id {HDL 9-1654} -suppress
