Description:

  Gets a list of pin objects on the current hardware design that match a
  specified search pattern. The default command gets a list of all pins in
  the subsystem design.


Arguments:

  -regexp - (Optional) Specifies that the search <patterns> are written as
  regular expressions. Both search <patterns> and -filter expressions must be
  written as regular expressions when this argument is used. Xilinx regular
  expression Tcl commands are always anchored to the start of the search
  string. You can add ".*" to the beginning or end of a search string to
  widen the search to include a substring. See
  http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/re_syntax.htm for help with regular
  expression syntax.

  Note: The Tcl built-in command regexp is not anchored, and works as a
  standard Tcl command. For more information refer to
  http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/regexp.htm.

  -filter <args> - (Optional) Filter the results list with the specified
  expression. The -filter argument filters the list of objects returned by
  get_pins based on property values on the pins. You can find the properties
  on an object with the report_property or list_property commands. In the
  case of the pins object, "DIR" and "TYPE" are some of the properties that
  can be used to filter results.

  The filter search pattern should be quoted to avoid having to escape
  special characters that may be found in net, pin, or cell names, or other
  properties. String matching is case-sensitive and is always anchored to the
  start and to the end of the search string. The wildcard "*" character can
  be used at the beginning or at the end of a search string to widen the
  search to include a substring of the property value.

  Note: The filter returns an object if a specified property exists on the
  object, and the specified pattern matches the property value on the object.
  In the case of the "*" wildcard character, this will match a property with
  a defined value of ""

  For string comparison, the specific operators that can be used in filter
  expressions are "equal" (==), "not-equal" (!=), "match" (=~), and
  "not-match" (!~). Numeric comparison operators <, >, <=, and >= can also be
  used. Multiple filter expressions can be joined by AND and OR (&& and ||).
  The following gets input pins that do NOT contain the "RESET" substring
  within their name:

    get_pins * -filter {DIRECTION == I && NAME !~ "*RESET*"}

  -of_objects <arg> - (Optional) Get the pins connected to the specified IP
  subsystem cell or net.

  Note: The -of_objects option requires objects to be specified using the
  get_* commands, such as get_cells or get_pins, rather than specifying
  objects by name. In addition, -of_objects cannot be used with a search
  <pattern>

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <patterns> - (Optional) Match hardware design pins against the
  specified patterns. 

  Note: More than one pattern can be specified to find multiple pins based on
  different search criteria. You must enclose multiple search patterns in
  braces {} to present the list as a single element


Examples:

  The following example gets a list of pins attached to the specified cell:

    get_pins -of [get_cells axi_gpio_0]

  Note: If there are no pins matching the pattern, the tool will return a
  warning.

  The following example gets a list of pins attached to the specified
  subsystem net:

    get_pins -of [get_nets ps7_axi_interconnect_0_M_AXI_BRESP]
