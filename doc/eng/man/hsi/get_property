Description:

  Gets the current value of the named property from the specified object or
  objects. If multiple objects are specified, a list of values is returned.

  If the property is not currently assigned to the object, or is assigned
  without a value, then the get_property command returns nothing, or the null
  string. If multiple objects are queried, the null string is added to the
  list of values returned.

  This command returns a value, or list of values, or returns an error if it
  fails.


Arguments:

  -min - (Optional) When multiple <objects> are specified, this option
  examines the values of the property specified by <name>, and returns the
  smallest value from the list of objects. Numeric properties are sorted by
  value. All other properties are sorted as strings.

  -max - (Optional) When multiple <objects> are specified, this option
  examines the values of the property specified by <name>, and returns the
  largest value from the list of objects. Numeric properties are sorted by
  value. All other properties are sorted as strings.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) The name of the property to be returned. The name is
  not case sensitive.

  <objects> - (Required) One or more objects to examine for the specified
  property.


Examples:

  The following example gets the NAME property from the specified cell:

    get_property NAME [lindex [get_cells] 0]

  The following example returns the BOARD property from the current
  hardware design:

    get_property BOARD [current_hw_design]
