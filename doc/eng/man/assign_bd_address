Description:

  Assign unmapped IP address segments to address spaces in the IP Integrator
  subsystem design.

  If the target address space is not specified, the IP Integrator feature
  will automatically assign the address segment to an available address space
  on a connected AXI master.

  If no bd_addr_seg objects are specified the assign_bd_address command will
  assign all unmapped address segments to any connected AXI master address
  spaces.

  This command returns the newly mapped address segments, or returns an error
  if it failed.

Arguments:

  -target_address_space <arg> - (Optional) The target address space to place
  the segment into.

  -boundary - (Optional) Assign address spaces to the hierarchical boundary
  of the design. This lets you allocate address space for memory that exists
  outside of the block design. Map scoped external slave interfaces into the
  address space at contiguous offsets beginning at 0x000_0000.

  -master_boundary - (Optional) For the scoped external master interfaces, a
  slave segment is created is mapped into internal masters on the scoped
  diagram, at the -offset and -range passed to it. .

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - The block design address segment objects to assign to the
  target address space.

Example:

  The following example automatically assigns the specified address segment
  object to an address space. In this example, the target space is not
  provided, so the IP Integrator feature automatically assigns one:

    assign_bd_address [get_bd_addr_segs \ 
    {/microblaze_1_local_memory/ilmb_bram_if_cntlr/SLMB/Mem }]
