Description:

  Step the current simulation to the next executable statement in the HDL
  source files.

  The line stepping feature lets you run the simulator stepping through the
  source code line-by-line. This is helpful if you are interested in
  observing how each line or feature of your HDL source affects the results
  of simulation.

  The step command returns information related to the next executable line
  from the HDL source file, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example runs the current executable line of the HDL source
  code, and pauses at the next executable line, returning information about
  that line:

    step 
    Stopped at time : 0 fs : File "C:/Data/ug937/sim/testbench.v" Line 17
