Description:

  This command reads memory files of type MEM, DAT, or COE, and adds the
  files to the in-memory design, or the current project, to initialize BRAM
  memory for behavioral simulation, synthesis and post-synthesis simulation.

  If the memory is not initialized in the design, then it will be initialized
  to all 0s.

  This command returns the name of the files read, or returns an error if it
  fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <files> - (Required) The name of the MEM, DAT, or COE file to read.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the tool will
  search for the specified file in the current working directory and then in
  the directory from which the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example:

    read_mem  C:/Data/design1.mem
