Description:

  Closes the currently active design. If the design has been modified, you
  will not be prompted to save the design prior to closing. You will need to
  run save_design or save_design_as to save any changes made to the design
  before using the close_design command.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example closes the current design:

    close_design

  Note: If multiple designs are open, you can specify the current design with
  the current_design command prior to using close_design .

  The following example sets the current design, then closes it:

    current_design rtl_1 
    close_design

  current_design sets rtl_1 as the active design, then the close_design
  command closes it.
