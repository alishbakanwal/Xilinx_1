Description:

  Propagates clock latency throughout a clock network, resulting in more
  accurate skew and timing results throughout the clock network.

  Note: This command operates silently and does not return direct feedback of
  its operation.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - (Required) A list of the clock objects to force propagation on.

Examples:

  This example specifies that the primary system clock from the top-level
  should be propagated:

    set_propagated_clock [get_clocks top/clk]

  This example specifies that all clocks from "sublevel1" should be propagated:

    set_propagated_clock [get_clocks sublevel1/*]
