Description:

  Compile Xilinx simulation libraries.

  Xilinx HDL-based simulation libraries come pre-compiled for use with Isim.
  The compxlib command compiles the simulation libraries for use by
  simulators other than Isim. Libraries must generally be compiled or
  recompiled with a new software release to update simulation models and to
  support a new version of a simulator.

  The command returns information related to the compiled libraries.

Arguments:

  -arch [ all | family ] - (Optional) Compile selected libraries to the
  specified device family. All device families will be generated by default.

   *  virtex6l (for Virtex-6 Lower Power)

   *  virtex7 (for Virtex-7)

   *  xa9500xl (for Automotive XC9500XL)

   *  xbr (for CoolRunner-II)

   *  xc9500 (for XC9500)

   *  xc9500xl (for XC9500XL)

   *  xpla3 (for CoolRunner XPLA3)

  -cfg - (Optional) Create a configuration file called compxlib.cfg with the
  default settings if it is not present in the current directory.

  -cfgopt <arg> - (Optional) Simulation configuration option specified in the
  form of <simulator:language:library:option>

  -dir <arg> - (Optional) Directory path for saving the compiled results.

  Note: By default the libraries are saved to the current working directory,
  or the directory the tool was launched from.

  -e <arg> - (Optional) Specify the existing directory where previously
  compxlib-compiled libraries are located

  -exclude_sublib - (Optional) Exclude the sub-library defined in the EDK
  .pao file for compilation. This option is only for use with for EDK
  libraries. See the Embedded System Tools Reference Manual (UG111) for
  information on sub-libraries.

  -exclude_superseded - (Optional) Exclude the superseded EDK library from
  compilation. This option is only for use with for EDK libraries. See the
  Embedded System Tools Reference Guide (UG111) for more information on
  superseded libraries.

  -force - (Optional) Overwrite the current pre-compiled libraries.

  -info <arg> - (Optional) Print Pre-Compiled library information to the
  specified directory.

  -l [ verilog | vhdl | all ] - (Optional) Compile libraries for the
  specified language. If this option is not specified then the language will
  be set according to the simulator selected with -simulator. For
  multi-language simulators both Verilog and VHDL libraries will be compiled.

  -lib <arg> - (Optional) Specify the library to compile. Valid values for
  library are:

   *  unisim (alias u)

   *  simprim (alias s)

   *  uni9000 (alias n)

   *  xilinxcorelib (alias c)

   *  coolrunner (alias r)

   *  edk (alias e)

  To specify multiple libraries, repeat the -lib options for each library.
  For example:

    .. -lib unisim -lib simprim ..

  Note: If you select EDK libraries (-lib edk), all ISE<tm tmtype="reg"/>
  libraries will be compiled because EDK libraries are dependent on UNISIM
  and SIMPRIM.

  -log <arg> - (Optional) Specify a custom log file name. By default the log
  file for the command is written to compxlib.log.

  -p <arg> - (Optional) Specify the directory to locate the simulator
  executable. This option is required if the target simulator is not
  specified in the $PATH or %PATH% environment variable; or to override the
  path from the $PATH or %Path% environment variable.

  -s <arg> - (Optional) Compile libraries for the specified simulator. Valid
  simulator values are:

   *  mti_se - Version 10.2a and later

   *  mti_pe - Version 10.2a and later

   *  mti_de - Version 10.2a and later

   *  questa - Version 10.2a and later

   *  vcs_mx - (Linux only) Version H2013.06 or later

   *  ncsim - (Linux only) Version 12.20-s16 or later

   *  riviera - Version 2013.06 or later

   *  active_hdl - (Windows only) Version 9.2 sp1

  -source_lib <arg> - (Optional) If specified, this directory will be
  searched for the library source files before searching the default path(s)
  defined by the in environment variables ($XILINX for ISE or $XILINX_EDK for
  EDK).

  Note: Do not use this option unless explicitly instructed to by Xilinx<tm
  tmtype="reg"/> Technical Support.

  -w - (Optional) Overwrite the pre-compiled libraries. By default, compxlib
  will not overwrite precompiled libraries.

  -32bit - (Optional) Perform 32-bit compilation instead of the default
  64-bit compilation.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example shows how to compile UNISIM and SIMPRIM libraries for
  ModelSim (VHDL) for a design using a Virtex<tm tmtype="reg"/>-7 device:

    compxlib -s mti_pe -arch virtex7 -lib unisim -lib simprim -l vhdl
