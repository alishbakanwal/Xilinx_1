Description:

  Returns a list of all High Speed IO (HSIO) cell objects that have been
  declared in the current design. These HSIO cell objects can be assigned to
  a variable or passed into another command.

  The list of high-speed IOs returned by all_hsios can also be limited or
  reduced by the filter command to filter according to properties assigned to
  the HSIO objects. Properties of an object can be returned by the
  list_property or report_property commands.

  The all_hsios command is scoped to return the objects hierarchically, from
  the top-level of the design or from the level of the current instance. By
  default the current instance is defined as the top level of the design, but
  can be changed by using the current_instance command.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example returns all HSIO objects in the current design:

    all_hsios

  The following example shows how the list returned can be directly passed to
  another command:

    set_false_path -from [all_hsios] -to [all_registers]
