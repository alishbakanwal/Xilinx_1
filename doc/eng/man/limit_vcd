Description:

  Specify the size limit, in bytes, of the Value Change Dump (VCD) file. This
  command operates like the Verilog $dumplimit simulator directive.

  When the specified file size limit has been reached, the dump process
  stops, and a comment is inserted into the VCD file to indicate that the
  file size limit has been reached.

  Note: You must run the open_vcd command before using the limit_vcd command.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <filesize> - (Required) Specify the file size limit of the open VCD file in
  bytes.

Examples:

  The following example limits the current VCD file:

    limit_vcd 1000
