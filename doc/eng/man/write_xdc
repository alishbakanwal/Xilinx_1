Description:

  Writes constraints to a Xilinx<tm tmtype="reg"/> Design Constraints file
  (XDC). The XDC can be exported from the top-level, which is the default, or
  from a specific hierarchical cell.

  The write_xdc command lets you write invalid XDC constraints so that you
  can quickly report constraints that have been ignored by the Vivado Design
  Suite due to a problem with the way the constraint is written or applied.
  This is useful for debugging constraint files applied in specific designs.

  This command can be used to create an XDC file from a design with UCF
  files. All constraints from the active constraint fileset will be exported
  to the XDC, even if they come from multiple files.

  Note: The write_xdc command will not convert all UCF constraints into XDC
  format, and is not intended to automatically convert UCF based designs to
  XDC. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite Migration Methodology Guide (UG911)
  for more information on migrating UCF constraints to XDC.

Arguments:

  -no_fixed_only - (Optional) Export both fixed and unfixed placement LOCs to
  the constraint file being written. By default only the fixed LOCs will be
  written to the XDC file. Fixed LOCs are associated with user-assigned
  placements, while unfixed LOCs are associated with tool assigned
  placements.

  -constraints <arg> - (Optional) Export constraints that are flagged valid,
  invalid, or all constraints (both valid and invalid). The default behavior
  is to export only valid constraints to the XDC file. Valid values are
  VALID, INVALID, or ALL.

  -cell <arg> - (Optional) The name of a hierarchical cell in the current
  design to export the constraints from. The constraints will be written to
  the specified XDC file relative to the specified cell.

  Note: A design must be open when using this option.

  -sdc - (Optional) Export only the timing constraints in a file format that
  is 100% SDC compatible from the current design. Does not export any other
  defined constraints.

  -no_tool_comments - (Optional) Do not add tool generated comments into the
  XDC file.

  -force - (Optional) Overwrite a file of the same name if one already exists.

  -exclude_timing - (Optional) Don`t export timing constraints. This results
  in an XDC file that contains only physical constraints.

  -exclude_physical - (Optional) Don`t export physical constraints. This
  results in an XDC file that contains only timing constraints.

  -add_netlist_placement - (Optional) Include placement constraints that are
  defined in the netlist file as part of the written XDC file.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - (Required) The filename of the XDC file to write.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example writes the valid and invalid constraints, including
  both fixed and unfixed cells, to the specified file:

    write_xdc -no_fixed_only -constraints all C:/Data/design.xdc

  This example writes only the invalid constraints, including both fixed and
  unfixed cells, to the specified file:

    write_xdc -constraints invalid C:/Data/bad_constraints.xdc

  The following example writes the physical constraints only, including any
  placement constraints defined in any netlist source files:

    write_xdc -exclude_timing -add_netlist_placement C:/Data/physical.xdc
