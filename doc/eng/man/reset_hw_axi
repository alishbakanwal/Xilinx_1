Description:

  Reset the STATUS properties of the specified hw_axi objects, or the current
  device.

  The reset_hw_axi restores the hw_axi core on the current device to a known
  state from which to begin running AXI transactions. The STATUS properties
  include:

   *  STATUS.AXI_READ_BUSY

   *  STATUS.AXI_READ_DONE

   *  STATUS.AXI_WRITE_BUSY

   *  STATUS.AXI_WRITE_DONE

   *  STATUS.BRESP - Write Response Channel Response. Indicates results of
      the write transfer.

   *  STATUS.RRESP - Read Response Channel Response. Indicates results of the
      read transfer.

  The command returns nothing if successful, and returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_axis> - (Required) The hw_axi objects to reset. The hw_axi must be
  specified as an object returned by the get_hw_axis command.

Example:

  The following example resets the hw_axis on the current device, restoring
  initial settings:

    reset_hw_axis [get_hw_axis]
