Description:

  Removes the specified hw_cfgmem object from the current hw_device.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <cfgmem> - (Required) Specify a hw_cfgmem object to remove from the current
  hw_device. The hw_cfgmem must be specified as an object as returned by
  get_hw_cfgmems or current_hw_cfgmem, rather than simply by name.

Example:

  The following example removes the current hw_cfgmem object:

    delete_hw_cfgmem [current_hw_cfgmem]
