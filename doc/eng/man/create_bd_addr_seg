Description:

  Create a new address segment object, bd_addr_seg, in the current IP
  Integrator subsystem design.

  This command returns the newly created master address segment object, or
  returns nothing if it failed.

Arguments:

  -range <arg> - (Required) Range, or size, of address segment to create
  expressed as an integer or hexadecimal value. The range should be specified
  as a number of bits expressed as a power of 2, such as 4096, or as an
  amount of memory to allocate such as 4K, 16M, 1G.

  -offset <arg> - (Required) Offset of the address segment. Written as an
  integer or hexadecimal value, such as 0x00000000.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <parent_addr_space> - (Required) Defines the parent address space of the
  segment.

  <slave_segment> - (Required) Maps a slave address segment of the master
  address segment being created.

  <name> - (Required) The name of the master address segment to create.

Example:

  The following example creates address segments for the Data and Instruction
  address spaces of the Microblaze core:

    create_bd_addr_seg -range 0x10000 -offset 0x41200000 \ 
       [get_bd_addr_spaces microblaze_1/Data] \ 
       [get_bd_addr_segs microblaze_1_axi_intc/s_axi/Reg] SEG1 
     
    create_bd_addr_seg -range 0x40000000 -offset 0x0 \ 
       [get_bd_addr_spaces microblaze_1/Instruction] \ 
       [get_bd_addr_segs microblaze_1_local_memory/ilmb_bram_if_cntlr/SLMB/Mem] \ 
       SEG1
