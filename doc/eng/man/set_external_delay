Description:

  Sets the external (feedback) delay in nanoseconds (ns) between an output
  and input port. The external delay is used in the calculation of the
  PLL/MMCM compensation delay for PLLs/MMCMs with external feedback.

  A min or max value can be specified. By default the value specified applies
  to both min (hold) and max (setup) compensation delays.

  The command returns the defined delay.

Arguments:

  -from <arg> - (Required) The output port name.

  -to <arg> - (Required) The input port name.

  -min - (Optional) Specifies the delay_value is a minimum delay value for
  hold time analysis.

  -max - (Optional) Specifies the delay_value is a maximum delay value for
  setup analysis.

  -add - (Optional) Add the specified delay to the existing external delay
  value.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <delay_value> - (Required) The external delay value specified as
  nanoseconds (ns). The default value is 0.

Examples:

  The following example sets the external feedback delay to 1.0 ns between
  the port ClkOut and ClkFb:

    set_external_delay -from [get_ports ClkOut] -to [get_ports ClkFb] 1.0
