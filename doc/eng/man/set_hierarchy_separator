Description:

  Sets the character that will be used for separating levels of hierarchy in
  the design.

  Note: This command operates silently and does not return direct feedback of
  its operation

Arguments:

  <separator> - (Optional) The new character to use as a hierarchy separator.
  Valid characters to use as the hierarchy separator are: `/`, `@`, `^`, `#`,
  `.`, and `|`. The default character is `/`, and is used when no <separator>
  is specified.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  This example changes the hierarchy separator to the `|` character:

    set_hierarchy_separator |

  The following example restores the default hierarchy separator, `/`:

    set_hierarchy_separator
