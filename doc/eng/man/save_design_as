Description:

  Saves the active constraint set as a new constraint set, with local copies
  of any constraint files that are part of the constraint set. The design
  name is not changed by this command.

  Use this command to save changes to the constraints in a design without
  affecting the current constraint files. This allows you to do some
  "what-if" type development of design constraints.

  Note: The new constraint set created by the save_design_as command will not
  be active in the design, although it will be referenced by the design. To
  make the constraint set active you must set the constrset property to point
  to the new constraint set for specific runs. See the example below.

Arguments:

  -dir <arg> - (Optional) The directory into which constraints files are
  saved. The constraint files from the active constraint set are copied into
  the specified directory, with relative paths from the current constraint
  files preserved in the new copies.

  -target_constrs_file <arg> - (Optional) Target constraints file for the new
  fileset. If a path is not specified, the file will be found or created in
  the fileset directory..

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) Specifies the name of the constraint set to write.

Examples:

  The following example saves the active constraint set into a new constraint
  set called newCon, and copies any constraint files for the constraint set
  into the specified directory:

    save_constraints_as -dir C:/Data/con1 newCon

  The following example saves the active constraint set as a new constraint
  set called newCon2, and copies any constraint files into the newCon2
  constraint directory under project sources. The constrset property for the
  specified synthesis and implementation runs are then set to point to the
  new constraint set:

    save_constraints_as newCon2 
    set_property constrset newCon2 [get_runs synth_1] 
    set_property constrset newCon2 [get_runs impl_1]

  Note: The constraint set is not active in the design until it has been set
  to active for the current runs.
