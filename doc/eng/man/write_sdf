Description:

  Writes the timing delays for cells in the design to a Standard Delay Format
  (SDF) file.

  The output SDF file can be used by the write_verilog command to create
  Verilog netlists for static timing analysis and timing simulation.

Arguments:

  -process_corner [ fast | slow ] - (Optional) Write delays for a specified
  process corner. Delays are greater in the slow process corner than in the
  fast process corner. Valid values are `slow` or `fast`. By default, the SDF
  file is written for the slow process corner.

  -cell <arg> - (Optional) Write the SDF file from a specific cell of the
  design hierarchy. The default is to create an SDF file for the whole
  design.

  -rename_top <arg> - (Optional) Rename the top module in the output SDF file
  as specified.

  -force - (Optional) Forces the overwrite of an existing SDF file of the
  same name.

  -mode [ timesim | sta ]- (Optional) Specifies the mode to use when writing
  the SDF file. Valid values are:

   *  timesim - Output an SDF file to be used for timing simulation. This is
      the default setting.

   *  sta - Output an SDF file to be used for static timing analysis (STA).

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - (Required) The file name of the SDF file to write. The SDF file is
  referenced in the Verilog netlist by the use of the -sdf_anno and -sdf_file
  arguments of the write_verilog command.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example writes an SDF file to the specified directory:

    write_sdf C:/Data/FPGA_Design/designOut.sdf
