Description:

  Create or open a Value Change Dump (VCD) file to capture simulation output.
  This command operates like the Verilog $dumpfile simulator directive.

  VCD is an ASCII file containing header information, variable definitions,
  and value change details of a set of HDL signals. The VCD file can be used
  to view simulation result in a VCD viewer or to estimate the power
  consumption of the design.

  When a VCD file has been opened, you can write the value changes from the
  simulation into the VCD file using checkpoint_vcd, flush_vcd, or log_vcd.
  In addition, you can pause and resume the collection of value change data
  with the stop_vcd and start_vcd commands.

  You can limit the size of the VCD file by using the limit_vcd command.

  To close the VCD file, use the close_vcd command.

  Note: You must use the open_vcd command before using any other *_vcd
  commands. Only one VCD file can be open at any time.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file_name> - (Optional) Is the name of the file into which to dump the
  current VCD information. When a filename is not specified, the default
  filename of dump.vcd is used. If the specified VCD file already exists,
  then open_vcd resets the VCD file to a new state, overwriting the current
  contents.

Examples:

  The following example opens the specified VCD file (design1.vcd) so that
  value changes can be written to it. The log_vcd command identifies all
  ports in the /tb/UUT scope, and only that level of the design hierarchy, to
  be written to the VCD file. The simulation is run for a specified period of
  time, and flush_vcd writes the current values of the HDL objects to the VCD
  file. Then close_vcd closes the open file.

    open_vcd design1.vcd 
    log_vcd -level 1 [get_objects filter { type == port } /tb/UUT/* ] 
    run 1000 
    flush_vcd 
    close_vcd
