Description:

  This command deletes a virtual hardware target from the current_hw_server.

  The hw_target object must be a virtual target created by the
  create_hw_target command, or an error will be returned.

  This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <target_object> - (Optional) Specifies the SVF or virtual target to delete.
  If the target is not specified the Vivado hardware manager will attempt to
  delete the current_hw_target.

Examples:

  The following example deletes the specified hw_target:

    delete_hw_target [lindex [get_hw_targets] 1]
