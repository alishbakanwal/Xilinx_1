Description:

  Deletes the specified Relationally Placed Macro (RPM) from the design.

  An RPM is a list of logic elements (FFS, LUT, CY4, RAM, etc.) collected
  into a set (U_SET, H_SET, and HU_SET). The placement of each element within
  the set, relative to other elements of the set, is controlled by Relative
  Location Constraints (RLOCs). Logic elements with RLOC constraints and
  common set names are associated in an RPM. Refer to the Constraints Guide
  (UG625) for more information on defining these constraints.

  Only user-defined RPMs can be deleted from the design. RPMs defined by the
  hierarchy or defined in the netlist cannot be deleted by this command.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <rpm> - (Required) The RPM to be deleted.

Examples:

  The following example deletes the specified RPM (cs_ila_0/U0) from the
  design:

    delete_rpm cs_ila_0/U0
