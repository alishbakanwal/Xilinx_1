Description:

  Writes package pin and port placement information into a comma separated
  value (CSV) file.

  The specific format and requirements of the CSV file are described in the
  Vivado Design Suite User Guide: I/O and Clock Planning (UG899).

Arguments:

  -force - (Optional) Overwrite the CSV file if it already exists.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - (Required) The filename of the CSV file to write.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example exports a CSV file from the current project:

    write_csv C:/Data/pinList.csv
