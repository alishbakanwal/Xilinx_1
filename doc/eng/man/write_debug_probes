Description:

  Writes a Vivado Design Suite logic analyzer probes file containing ILA
  debug cores and signal probes added to the current design. The debug probes
  data file typically has a .ltx file extension.

  ILA cores are added to the design using the create_debug_core command. ILA
  probes are added to the design using the create_debug_port command, and
  connected to nets in your design using the connect_debug_port command.

  The specific information and use of the debug probes file is described in
  the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Vivado Programming and Debugging
  (UG908).

  write_debug_probes [-cell <arg>] [-force] [-quiet] [-verbose] <file>

Arguments:

  -cell <arg> - (Optional) Specify the hierarchical name of a reconfigurable
  partition cell to export a partial probe file.

  -force - (Optional) Overwrite the specified file if it already exists.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - (Required) The file name of the debug probes file to write.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example write a debug probe file from the current design:

    write_debug_probes C:/Data/designProbes.ltx
