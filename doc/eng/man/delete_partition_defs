Description:

  Delete the specified Partition Definition (partitionDef) objects from the
  current project.

  This command returns a transcript of the file merge process, returns
  nothing without file merge, or returns an error if the command fails.

Arguments:

  -merge <arg> - (Optional) Specify the name of a fileset to merge files from
  the default Reconfigurable Module (DEFAULT_RM) of a deleted partitionDef
  object. The files will be moved from the default RM to the specified
  fileset.

  Note: If -merge is not specified, then all files in the default RM are
  removed from the project.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <partition_defs> - (Required) Specify one or more partitionDef objects to
  remove from the current project. The partitionDef objects can be specified
  by name, or as objects returned by the get_partition_defs command.

Example:

  The following example deletes all the partitionDefs from the current
  design, merging files from the default RMs of each partition into the
  source fileset for the design:

    delete_partition_defs -merge sources_1 [get_partition_defs]
