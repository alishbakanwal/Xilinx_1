Description:

  Opens a new or existing I/O Pin Planning design.

  Note: The design_mode property for the current source fileset must be
  defined as PinPlanning in order to open an I/O design. If not, you will get
  the following error:

    ERROR: The design mode of `sources_1` must be PinPlanning

Arguments:

  -name <arg> - (Optional) The name of a new or existing I/O Pin Planning
  design.

  -part <arg> - (Optional) The Xilinx device to use when creating a new
  design. If the part is not specified the default part will be used.

  -constrset <arg> - (Optional) The name of the constraint fileset to use
  when opening an I/O design.

  Note: The -constrset argument must refer to a constraint fileset that
  exists. It cannot be used to create a new fileset. Use create_fileset for
  that purpose.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following creates a new I/O design called myIO:

    open_io_design -name myIO

  Note: The default source set, constraint set, and part will be used in this
  case.

  The following example opens an existing I/O design called myIO, and
  specifies the constraint set to be used:

    open_io_design -name myIO -constrset topCon
