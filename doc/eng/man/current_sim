  Get or set the current Vivado simulation object.

  This command can be used after the Vivado simulator has been launched to
  return or set the current simulation object.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <simulationObject> - (Optional) The name of the simulation object to set as
  the current simulation. If a <simulationObject> is not specified, the
  command returns the current simulation of the current project.
