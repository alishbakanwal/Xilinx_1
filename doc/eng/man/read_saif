Description:

  Reads a Switching Activity Interchange Format (SAIF) file for use during
  power analysis by the report_power command, or power optimization by
  power_opt_design. The read_saif command will annotate the design nodes with
  activity from the SAIF file and estimate power appropriately.

  Running report_power or power_opt_design after reading the SAIF file will
  use the activity rates from the specified file during optimization and
  analysis.

Arguments:

  -strip_path <arg> - (Optional) Strip the specified instance path prefix
  from elements in the SAIF file to allow them to be mapped properly to
  instances in the current design.

  Note: The instance path specified should not begin with a '/'. The
  read_saif parser looks for design net names, which do not have a leading
  '/'.

  -no_strip - (Optional) Do not strip first two levels of hierarchy from the
  SAIF file.

  -out_file <arg> - (Optional) The name of an output file where unmatched
  nets and other messages are reported. This file is created during the
  import of the SAIF file. If the -out_file option is not specified, the
  information is not saved to a file.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the tool will
  write the specified file to the current working directory, or the directory
  from which the tool was launched.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - (Required) The name of the SAIF file to read.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the tool will
  search for the specified file in the current working directory and then in
  the directory from which the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example:

    read_saif -strip_path design/top/F1 C:/Data/design1.saif
