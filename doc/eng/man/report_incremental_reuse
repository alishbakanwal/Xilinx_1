Description:

  For use with the incremental compilation flow, this command reports on the
  amount of design overlap between the current design and an incremental
  checkpoint loaded using the read_checkpoint -incremental command.

  This report analyzes the loaded incremental checkpoint against the current
  design to see if the two are sufficiently correlated to drive incremental
  placement and routing. A low correlation between the current design and the
  checkpoint should discourage using the checkpoint as a basis for
  incremental place and route. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide:
  Implementation (UG904) for more information on incremental place and route.

  If there is a low correlation of reuse between the current design and the
  loaded incremental checkpoint, you will need to restore the original design
  using open_run or read_checkpoint. Alternatively, you can overload the
  incremental checkpoint in the current design by issuing the read_checkpoint
  -incremental command again to specify a new incremental checkpoint.

Arguments:

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file. The
  specified file will be overwritten if one already exists, unless -append is
  also specified. By default, the report will be written to the Tcl console.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -name <arg> - (Optional) The name to assign to the results when run in GUI
  mode.

  -cells <args> - (Optional) Specifies the cells to use from the DCP file.

  -hierarchical - (Optional) Generate a text-based hierarchical incremental
  reuse report.

  -hierarchical_depth <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the depth level for the
  text-based hierarchical incremental reuse report. The default is 0.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example loads an incremental checkpoint into the current
  design, and then reports the correlation of the loaded incremental
  checkpoint to the current design:

    read_checkpoint -incremental C:/Data/reuse_checkpoint1.dcp 
    report_incremental_reuse
