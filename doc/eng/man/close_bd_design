Description:

  Closes the specified IP subsystem design in the IP Integrator feature of
  the Vivado Design Suite.

  If the design has been modified, you will not be prompted to save the
  design prior to closing. You will need to run save_bd_design to save any
  changes made to the design before using the close_bd_design command.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - The name of the IP subsystem design object to close.

Example:

  The following example closes the current IP subsystem design in the current
  project:

    close_bd_design [current_bd_design]
