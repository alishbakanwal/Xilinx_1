Description:

  Load the netlist and constraint files of the specified reconfigurable
  module (RM), or all modules from a given run, into the current design.

  You can create the RM using the create_reconfig_module command, and then
  load it into the design later.

  Although a single partition cell can contain multiple RMs, only one can be
  loaded into the current design as the active module for that cell. Use the
  load_reconfig_module command to change the active module for a specific
  partition cell.

  The combination of active modules in the design, and all other logic, is
  called a configuration of the design.

Arguments:

  -force - (Optional) Force the load of the RM even when there are
  outstanding design changes to be saved. If there are pending design
  changes, and -force is not specified, an error will be returned.

  Note: You should use save_design prior to using load_reconfig_module.

  -run <arg> - (Optional) The run from which to load RMs. The specific
  implementation of the modules for the given run are loaded.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <reconfig_modules> - (optional) The names of reconfigurable modules to load.

  Note: You must use either the -run argument, or specify one or more RMs to
  load.

Examples:

  The example code below loads the netlist and constraints of the
  reconfigurable module named BramFirst for the specified partition cell,
  then loads the BramSecond to make it the active module for the same cell:

    load_reconfig_modules -reconfig_modules U2_RP_Count:BramFirst 
    load_reconfig_modules -reconfig_modules U2_RP_Count:BramSecond

  Note: The reconfigurable module is specified by the hierarchical name
  <cell>:<name>.
