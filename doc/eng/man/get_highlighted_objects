Description:

  Gets the highlighted objects in the current design open in the Vivado IDE.
  Objects can be highlighted with the highlight_objects command.

  You can get all highlighted objects in the design, or specify highlighted
  objects by color, by color index, or by RGB value.

  Note: This Tcl command works only when Vivado is run in GUI mode.

Arguments:

  -color_index arg - (Optional) Valid values are integers from 1 to 19.
  Specifies the color index used for highlighting the selected object or
  objects. The color index is defined by the Highlight category of the Tools
  > Options > Themes command. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide:
  Using the IDE (UG893) for more information on setting themes.

  -rgb args - (Optional) The color used for highlighting objects in the form
  of an RGB code specified as {R G B}. For instance, {255 255 0} specifies
  the color yellow.

  -color arg - (Optional) The color used for highlighting the specified
  object or objects. Supported highlight colors are: red, green, blue,
  magenta, yellow, cyan, and orange.

  Note: White is the color used to display selected objects with the
  select_objects command.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.
