Description:

  While the set_msg_config command allows you to define message severity,
  message limits, and suppress messages. This command only sets the severity
  of a specified message ID from one type, such as WARNING, to another type,
  such as ERROR.

  Every message delivered by the tool has a unique global message ID that
  consists of an application sub-system code and a message identifier. This
  results in a message ID that looks like the following:

    "Common 17-54" 
    "Netlist 29-28" 
    "Synth 8-3295"

  Use this command to customize the message severity returned by the tool to
  specific levels appropriate to your usage.

  Note: You can restore the message severity of a specific message ID to its
  original setting with the reset_msg_severity command.

Arguments:

  <id> - (Required) The message ID, which is included in all returned
  messages. For example, "Common 17-54" or "Netlist 29-28".

  <severity> - (Required) The severity of the message. There are five message
  severities:

   *  ERROR - An ERROR condition implies an issue has been encountered which
      will render design results unusable and cannot be resolved without user
      intervention.

   *  {CRITICAL WARNING} - A CRITICAL WARNING message indicates that certain
      input/constraints will either not be applied or are outside the best
      practices for a FPGA family. User action is strongly recommended.

      Note: Since this is a two word value, it must be enclosed in {} or "".

   *  WARNING - A WARNING message indicates that design results may be
      sub-optimal because constraints or specifications may not be applied as
      intended. User action may be taken or may be reserved.

   *  INFO - An INFO message is the same as a STATUS message, but includes a
      severity and message ID tag. An INFO message includes a message ID to
      allow further investigation through answer records if needed.

   *  STATUS - A STATUS message communicates general status of the process
      and feedback to the user regarding design processing. A STATUS message
      does not include a message ID.

      Note: Because STATUS messages do not have message IDs, you cannot
      change the severity level of a STATUS message.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example reduces the significance of message ID Common 17-54
  from a CRITICAL WARNING to a WARNING so that it causes less concern when
  encountered:

    set_msg_severity "Common 17-54" WARNING

  The following example elevates a common INFO message to a Critical Warning:

    set_msg_severity "Common 17-81" "CRITICAL WARNING"
