Description:

  Interactive physical optimization can be used in two ways:

   *  Applying post-placement physical optimizations to the pre-placement
      netlist to improve the overall placement result and improve design
      performance.

   *  Saving the physical optimizations in a Tcl script to be repeated as
      needed.

  To apply post-placement optimizations to the pre-placement netlist, you can
  reset the implementation run and open the synthesized design, or open the
  opt_design checkpoint, and read the iphys_opt Tcl script to apply the
  physical optimizations.

  You can apply all optimizations from the iphys_opt Tcl script, or apply
  specific optimizations using the options of the read_iphys_opt_tcl command.
  You can also include any optimizations that were defined but skipped during
  physical optimization.

  If the iphys_opt Tcl script includes placement data, you can use that data
  to place the optimized cells in the design.

  After reading the iphys_opt Tcl script, and placing the optimized cells,
  you can rerun placement for the overall design. The design now incorporates
  the benefits of the phys_opt_design optimizations before placement, such as
  fewer high-fanout nets due to replication, and fewer long distance paths
  from block RAM outputs. The results should be a better placement, and
  improved design performance, due to the early application of netlist
  optimizations.

  This command returns a transcript of its processes, or returns an error if
  it fails.

Arguments:

  -fanout_opt - (Optional) Apply the fanout optimizations that are defined in
  the specified interactive physical optimization Tcl script.

  -critical_cell_opt - (Optional) Applies the cell replication optimizations
  that are defined in the specified Tcl script.

  -placement_opt - (Optional) Applies the cell placement optimizations that
  are defined in the specified Tcl script.

  -rewire - (Optional) Applies the logic cone refactoring that are defined in
  the specified Tcl script.

  -dsp_register_opt - (Optional) Applies the DSP optimizations that are
  defined in the specified interactive physical optimization Tcl script.

  -bram_register_opt - (Optional) Applies the BRAM optimizations that are
  defined in the specified Tcl script.

  -shift_register_opt - (Optional) Applies the shift register optimization
  that are defined in the specified Tcl script.

  -critical_pin_opt - Applies the pin-swapping that are defined in the
  specified Tcl script.

  -include_skipped_optimization - (Optional) Apply the skipped optimizations
  that are defined in the input Tcl script, as well as the standard
  optimizations. These are optimizations identified by phys_opt_design that
  are skipped because suitable locations for optimized logic cannot be found.
  When this option is specified, the iphys_opt_design command will attempt to
  use the included skipped optimizations in the pre-placement netlist.

  -place - (Optional) Restore the placement as defined in the input Tcl
  script. If the input iphys_opt Tcl script includes placement data as
  specified when the Tcl script is written, then this option causes that
  placement data to be applied. If there is not placement data in the input
  script, the -place option is ignored.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <input> - (Required) The name of the interactive physical optimization Tcl
  file to read.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the tool will
  search for the specified file in the current working directory and then in
  the directory from which the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example applies the BRAM optimizations that are defined in
  the specified interactive physical optimization Tcl script, and applies any
  placement data for the optimized cells:

    open_checkpoint C:/Data/opt_design.dcp 
    read_iphys_opt_tcl -shift_register_opt -place C:/Data/my_iphys_opt.tcl
