Description:

  This command defines a clock`s source or network latency for specified
  clocks, ports, or pins.

  Note: This command operates silently and does not return direct feedback of
  its operation.

  Source latency is the time in nanoseconds that a clock signal takes to
  propagate from its waveform origin to the clock definition point in the
  design. For example, this would be the time delay for the clock to
  propagate from its source (oscillator) on the system board to the FPGA
  input port.

  Network latency is the time a clock signal takes to propagate from its
  definition point in the design to a register clock pin on the timing path.
  The total clock latency at a register clock pin is the sum of a clock`s
  source latency and network latency.

Arguments:

  -clock <args> - (Optional) Specifies a list of clocks associated with the
  <latency> assigned to the specified <objects>. If the -clock argument is
  not used, the clock <latency> will be applied to all clocks passing through
  the specified pins and ports.

  -rise - (Optional) Defines the latency for the rising clock edge.

  -fall - (Optional) Defines the latency for the falling clock edge.

  -min - (Optional) Defines the minimum latency for the specified clocks for
  multi-corner analysis.

  -max - (Optional) Defines the maximum latency for the specified clocks for
  multi-corner analysis.

  Note: The -min and -max options are mutually exclusive.

  -source - (Optional) Defines the specified <latency> as a source latency.
  Clock source latencies can only be specified for clock objects and clock
  source pins.

  Note: Without the -source argument the <latency> is considered as network
  latency.

  -late - (Optional) The time delay specified by -latency is how late the
  clock edge arrives.

  -early - (Optional) The time delay specified by -latency is how early the
  clock edge arrives.

  Note: The -early and -late options are mutually exclusive, and can only be
  specified when -source is also specified.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <latency> - (Required) The amount of clock latency, specified as
  nanoseconds, to apply.

  <objects> - (Required) The clock, port, or pin objects on which to apply
  the latency. Specifying pin or port objects assigns the latency to all
  register clock pins in the transitive fanout of the pins or ports. If
  -clock is used, the latency is applied to all register clock pins of the
  specified clocks.

  Note: If <objects> specifies a clock, the -clock argument is unnecessary,
  and is ignored.

Examples:

  This example will set an early latency on the rising edge of CLK_A.

    set_clock_latency -source -rise -early 0.4 [get_ports CLK_A]
