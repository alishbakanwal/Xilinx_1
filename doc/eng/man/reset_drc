Description:

  Clear the DRC results from the specified named result set.

  Note: If no -name is specified, all open DRC results windows will be closed.

  This command operates silently, returning nothing if successful, or
  returning an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -name <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the name of the DRC results to be
  cleared. The name is established by the -name argument in the report_drc
  command.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example clears the specified results set from memory and the
  GUI:

    reset_drc -name DRC1
