Description:

  Delete a user-defined probe from the current hw_ila. The user-define probe
  must be created by the create_hw_probe command.

  This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_probe> s - Specify user-defined hw_probe objects to delete from the
  current ILA core. Probes must be specified as objects returned by the
  get_hw_probes command.

Examples:

  The following example deletes a user-defined hw_probe object on the current
  ILA core:

    delete_hw_probe [get_hw_probe probeAR]
