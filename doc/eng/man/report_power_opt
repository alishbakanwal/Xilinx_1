Description:

  Report power optimizations that have been performed on the design with the
  power_opt_design command.

  Note: By default the report is written to the Tcl console or STD output.
  However, the results can also be written to a file or returned as a string
  if desired.

Arguments:

  -cell <args> - (Optional) Report power optimization for the specified cell
  or cell instances. By default, the power optimizations performed on the
  whole design are reported.

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into a file. The specified file
  will be overwritten if one already exists.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -format [ text | xml ] - (Optional) Specify the file format of the Power
  Optimization report when used with -file. The default file output is a text
  format file. The Vivado tool can also write an XML format file to allow for
  use by third party applications.

  Note: When -format xml is specified, the -append option is not supported.

  -name <arg> - (Optional) The name to assign to the Power Optimization
  report when the command is run in GUI mode.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option, and is not
  compatible with the XML format.

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string rather than
  to the standard output. The Tcl string can be captured by a variable
  definition and parsed or otherwise processed.

  Note: This argument cannot be used with the -file option.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example reports the power optimizations performed on the
  current design, writing them to the specified file in an XML format:

    report_power_opt -format xml -file C:/Data/power_opt.xml
