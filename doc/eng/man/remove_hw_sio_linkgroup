Description:

  Removes the specified group that associates communication links between TX
  and RX objects on the GTs of the IBERT debug core defined on the current
  hardware device.

  Vivado Serial I/O analyzer is a link-based analyzer. The links define the
  communication paths and protocols between transmitters and receivers of the
  GigaBit transceivers on the device. Link groups, or hw_sio_linkgroup
  objects, let you associate links into related groups, to collectively
  configure properties and run scans.

  Note: The remove_hw_sio_linkgroup command removes the specified
  association, but does not remove the underlying communication links. Us the
  remove_hw_sio_link command to remove those objects.

  This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_sio_linkgroups> - (Required) Specify one or more hw_sio_linkgroup
  objects to remove. The hw_sio_linkgroup must be specified as an object as
  returned by the create_hw_sio_linkgroup or get_hw_sio_linkgroups commands.

Example:

  The following example removes the specified linkgroup:

    remove_hw_sio_linkgroup [get_hw_sio_linkgroups {LINKGROUP_0}]
