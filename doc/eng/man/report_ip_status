Description:

  This command examines the IP cores in the current project, and reports the
  state of the IP with regard to the latest IP catalog. The following
  information is included in the IP Status report:

   *  Instance Name - The name of the IP core in the current project.

   *  IP Status - A description of the state of the IP in the current project.

   *  Recommendation - A recommended action based on the status.

   *  Lock Status - An explanation of the lock status of the IP in the
      current project.

   *  Change Log - A reference to the change log for the IP update in the
      catalog. This will provide a description of the changes in the latest
      IP.

   *  IP Name - The name of the IP core in the catalog.

   *  IP Version - The version of the IP in use in the current project.

   *  New Version - The latest version of the IP in the catalog.

   *  New license - The license status for the new IP version.

   *  Original Part - The original part associated with the IP in the catalog.

  IP cores that are out of date, or locked, may need to be upgraded and the
  output products regenerated. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide:
  Designing with IP (UG896) for more information.

  The report_ip_status command checks the available licenses on the local
  machine, or on the license server, for all IP cores in the current project.
  If a license can be found, the license information is printed. If the
  license cannot be found, this information is also printed.

  This command returns the IP status report, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -name <arg> - (Optional) The name to assign to the results when run in GUI
  mode.

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file. The
  specified file will be overwritten if one already exists, unless -append is
  also specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string rather than
  to the standard output. The Tcl string can be captured by a variable
  definition and parsed or otherwise processed.

  Note: This argument cannot be used with the -file option.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example reports the IP status to the specified file,
  appending the results if the file already exists:

    report_ip_status -file C:/Data/reports/ip_status.txt -append
