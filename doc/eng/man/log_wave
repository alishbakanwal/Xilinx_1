Description:

  Log simulation activity for the specified HDL objects into the waveform
  database file (.wdb) for viewing using Vivado simulator waveform viewer.

  In the Vivado simulator, an HDL object is an entity that can hold a value,
  such as a wire, signal, or register.

  Unlike add_wave, this command does not add the waveform object to waveform
  configuration. It simply enables logging of waveform activity to the Vivado
  simulator waveform database (WDB). See the Vivado Design Suite User Guide:
  Logic Simulation (UG900) for more information.

  This command returns nothing.

Arguments:

  -recursive | -r - (Optional) Recursively log the waveform activity of the
  specified HDL objects, and the children of the specified HDL objects.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hdl_objects> - (Required) Specifies the HDL objects to include in the
  Vivado simulator waveform database file. The level of hierarchy is also
  represented in the hdl_objects pattern. For instance /tb/UUT/* indicates
  all HDL objects within the /tb/UUT level of the design.

Examples:

  The following example logs the waveform activities for the specified HDL
  objects.

    log_wave -r [get_objects /testbench/dut/*]
