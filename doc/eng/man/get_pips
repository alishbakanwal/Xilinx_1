Description:

  Programmable interconnect points, or PIPs, provide the physical routing
  paths on the device used to connect logic networks. This command returns a
  list of PIPs on the device that match a specified search pattern. The
  command requires a design to be open.

  The default command gets a list of all PIPs on the device. However, this is
  not a recommended use of the command due to the number of pips on a device.
  You should specify the -of_objects argument to limit the number of pips
  returned.

  Note: To improve memory and performance, the get_* commands return a
  container list of a single type of objects (e.g. cells, nets, pins, or
  ports). You can add new objects to the list (using lappend for instance),
  but you can only add the same type of object that is currently in the list.
  Adding a different type of object, or string, to the list is not permitted
  and will result in a Tcl error.

Arguments:

  -regexp - (Optional) Specifies that the search <patterns> are written as
  regular expressions. Both search <patterns> and -filter expressions must be
  written as regular expressions when this argument is used. Xilinx regular
  expression Tcl commands are always anchored to the start of the search
  string. You can add ".*" to the beginning or end of a search string to
  widen the search to include a substring. See
  http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html for help with regular expression
  syntax.

  Note: The Tcl built-in command regexp is not anchored, and works as a
  standard Tcl command. For more information refer to
  http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/regexp.htm.

  -nocase - (Optional) Perform case-insensitive matching when a pattern has
  been specified. This argument applies to the use of -regexp only.

  -filter <args> - (Optional) Filter the results list with the specified
  expression. The -filter argument filters the list of objects returned by
  get_pips based on property values on the PIPs. You can find the properties
  on an object with the report_property or list_property commands. Any
  property/value pair can be used as a filter. In the case of the PIP object,
  "IS_DIRECTIONAL" and "FROM_PIN" are two of the properties that can be used
  to filter results.

  The filter search pattern should be quoted to avoid having to escape
  special characters that may be found in net, pin, or cell names, or other
  properties. String matching is case-sensitive and is always anchored to the
  start and to the end of the search string. The wildcard "*" character can
  be used at the beginning or at the end of a search string to widen the
  search to include a substring of the property value.

  Note: The filter returns an object if a specified property exists on the
  object, and the specified pattern matches the property value on the object.
  In the case of the "*" wildcard character, this will match a property with
  a defined value of "".

  For string comparison, the specific operators that can be used in filter
  expressions are "equal" (==), "not-equal" (!=), "match" (=~), and
  "not-match" (!~). Numeric comparison operators <, >, <=, and >= can also be
  used. Multiple filter expressions can be joined by AND and OR (&& and ||).
  The following gets input pins that do NOT contain the "RESET" substring
  within their name:

    get_pins * -filter {DIRECTION == IN && NAME !~ "*RESET*"}

  Boolean (bool) type properties can be directly evaluated in filter
  expressions as true or not true:

    -filter {IS_PRIMITIVE && !IS_LOC_FIXED}

  -of_objects <args> - (Optional) Return the PIPs of the specified sites,
  tiles, wires, nodes, pips, or nets objects. Xilinx recommends that you
  always use the -of_objects argument to limit the runtime and memory used by
  the get_pips command. The number of programmable interconnect points
  returned can be considerable.

  Note: The -of_objects option requires objects to be specified using the
  get_* commands, such as get_cells or get_pins, rather than specifying
  objects by name. In addition, -of_objects cannot be used with a search
  <pattern>.

  -uphill - (Optional) Return the PIPs uphill of the specified wire or PIPs.
  Uphill PIPs precede the specified object in the logic network.

  -downhill - (Optional) Return the PIPs downhill of the specified wire or
  PIPs. Downhill PIPs follow the specified object in the logic network.

  -from <args> - (Optional) Defines the starting points of the pips to get
  from wire or site_pin objects. This option can be combined with -uphill.
  The default is to return pips downhill of a start point. By default, all
  pips will be returned.

  -to <args> - (Optional) Defines the ending points of the pips to get from
  wire or site_pin objects. This option can be combined with -uphill. The
  default is to return pips downhill of a start point to the specified end
  point. By default, all pips will be returned.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <patterns> - (Optional) Return PIPs matching the specified search patterns.
  The default pattern is the wildcard `*` which gets a list of all PIPs on
  the device. More than one search pattern can be specified to find PIPs
  based on different search criteria.

  Note: You must enclose multiple search patterns in braces, {}, or quotes,
  "", to present the list as a single element.

Examples:

  The following example returns the PIPs associated with the specified tile:

    get_pips -of_object [get_tiles DSP_R_X9Y75]
