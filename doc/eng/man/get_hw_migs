Description:

  Returns the hw_mig objects on the current hardware device.

  Memory IP included in the Xilinx IP Catalog are used to generate memory
  controllers and interfaces for Xilinx<tm tmtype="reg"/> devices. Memory IP
  includes different IP cores from the Xilinx IP catalog depending on the
  device architecture and memory interface specified. Refer to Zynq-7000 AP
  SoC and 7 Series Devices Memory Interface Solutions (UG586), or UltraScale
  Architecture-Based FPGAs Memory Interface Solutions (PG150), for details of
  the available memory IP.

  When added to a design, the memory IP needs to be implemented into the
  design. This occurs after the design is synthesized, during the design
  optimization phase of implementation, or opt_design, or can be done
  manually with the implement_mig_cores command.

  A memory controller can be debug enabled when added into the design from
  the Xilinx IP catalog. In the Vivado logic analyzer, or the Vivado Lab
  Edition, memory controllers implemented into a design are associated with
  hw_mig objects, one hw_mig object per debug-enabled memory controller. The
  hw_mig object will have all the properties needed to get the calibration
  status and draw the per-bit eye margin views.

  In the Vivado logic analyzer, or Vivado Lab Edition, the hw_mig object lets
  you verify the calibration and read window margins in your memory interface
  design. You can use the hardware manager GUI to check the calibration
  status, verify the read margin for both rising and falling edges of the
  clock or DQS. You can also use an ILA core to verify the data integrity for
  the read and write operations.

  This command returns a list of hw_mig objects on the current hardware
  device, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -of_objects <arg> - (Optional) Return the memory IP objects of the
  specified hw_server, hw_target, or hw_device objects.

  Note: The -of_objects option requires objects to be specified using the
  get_* commands, such as get_cells or get_pins, rather than specifying
  objects by name. In addition, -of_objects cannot be used with a search
  <pattern>.

  -regexp - (Optional) Specifies that the search <patterns> are written as
  regular expressions. Both search <patterns> and -filter expressions must be
  written as regular expressions when this argument is used. Xilinx regular
  expression Tcl commands are always anchored to the start of the search
  string. You can add ".*" to the beginning or end of a search string to
  widen the search to include a substring. See
  http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html for help with regular expression
  syntax.

  Note: The Tcl built-in command regexp is not anchored, and works as a
  standard Tcl command. For more information refer to
  http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/regexp.htm.

  -nocase - (Optional) Perform case-insensitive matching when a pattern has
  been specified. This argument applies to the use of -regexp only.

  -filter <args> - (Optional) Filter the results list with the specified
  expression. The -filter argument filters the list of objects returned by
  get_hw_migs based on property values on the objects. You can find the
  properties on an object with the report_property or list_property commands.
  In the case of the hw_mig object, "DISPLAY_NAME", "BYTES", and "NIBBLES"
  are some of the properties that can be used to filter results.

  The filter search pattern should be quoted to avoid having to escape
  special characters that may be found in net, pin, or cell names, or other
  properties. String matching is case-sensitive and is always anchored to the
  start and to the end of the search string. The wildcard "*" character can
  be used at the beginning or at the end of a search string to widen the
  search to include a substring of the property value.

  Note: The filter returns an object if a specified property exists on the
  object, and the specified pattern matches the property value on the object.
  In the case of the "*" wildcard character, this will match a property with
  a defined value of "".

  For string comparison, the specific operators that can be used in filter
  expressions are "equal" (==), "not-equal" (!=), "match" (=~), and
  "not-match" (!~). Numeric comparison operators <, >, <=, and >= can also be
  used. Multiple filter expressions can be joined by AND and OR (&& and ||).
  The following gets input pins that do NOT contain the "RESET" substring
  within their name:

    get_pins * -filter {DIRECTION == IN && NAME !~ "*RESET*"}

  Boolean (bool) type properties can be directly evaluated in filter
  expressions as true or not true:

    -filter {IS_PRIMITIVE && !IS_LOC_FIXED}

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <patterns> - (Optional) Match hw_mig objects against the specified
  patterns. The default pattern is the wildcard `*` which gets a list of all
  hw_migs available on the current hardware device.

Example:

  The following example gets the memory IP defined on the current hardware
  target:

    get_hw_migs -of_objects [current_hw_target]
