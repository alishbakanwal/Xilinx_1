Description:

  Sets the load capacitance on output ports to the specified value. The load
  capacitance is used during power analysis when running the report_power
  command, but is not used during timing analysis.

  Note: The default unit of capacitance is picofarads (pF), but can be
  changed using the set_units command.

  This command operates silently and does not return direct feedback of its
  operation.

Arguments:

  -max - (Optional) Specify the maximum load capacitance value.

  -min - (Optional) Specify the minimum load capacitance value.

  -rise - (Optional) Defines the rising edge load capacitance on the
  specified ports.

  -fall - (Optional) Defines the falling edge load capacitance on the
  specified ports.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <capacitance> - (Required) The value of the load capacitance. The value is
  specified as a floating point value >= 0. The default is 0.

  <objects> - (Required) A list of output port objects to assign the
  capacitance load to. All outputs in the design may be obtained using the
  all_outputs command.

Examples:

  The following example sets the specified load capacitance value for all
  ports:

    set_load 5.5 [all_outputs]

  The following example sets the rising and falling edge load capacitance for
  the specified output ports:

    set_load -rise -fall 8 [get_ports wbOutput*]
