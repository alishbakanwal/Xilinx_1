Description:

  Connect the interface pins on an IP Integrator cell to other interface
  pins, or to external interface ports. An interface is a grouping of signals
  that share a common function in the IP Integrator subsystem design.

  This command will create an interface net of the name specified by the
  -intf_net option, will connect to an existing interface net of the
  specified name, or will assign a name if none is specified.

  Returns the connected interface net object, or returns an error.

Arguments:

  -intf_net <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the name of an existing interface
  net, previously created by the create_bd_intf_net command, or a new
  interface net that will be created. If no name is provided, the IP
  Integrator feature will automatically name the net.

  -boundary_type [ lower | upper | both ] - (Optional) Specifies the search
  area for making a connection to an interface pin of an hierarchical block.
  The default of both searches the current level of the block design
  hierarchy, and downward, to find connecting objects. Specify upper to
  search only the current level of hierarchy, specify lower to search from
  the bottom of the hierarchy upward.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <object1> - (Required) The first interface pin or port to connect the net to.

  <object2> - (Required) The second interface pin or port to connect the net
  to.

Example:

  The following example connects an interface pin on an IP Integrator core to
  an interface port in the subsystem design:

    connect_bd_intf_net [get_bd_intf_pins clk_wiz_1/CLK_IN1_D] \ 
       [get_bd_intf_ports /diff_clock_rtl]
