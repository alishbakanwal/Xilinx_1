Description:

  Relaunch the simulator to perform analysis and verification of an updated
  design.

  The relaunch_sim command suspends the current simulation, recompiles the
  current design into a new simulation snapshot, then connects the current
  simulation to the new snapshot, and restarts the simulation.

  In the typical HDL debug cycle you will compile a design into a simulation
  snapshot and launch a simulation, configuring the Vivado simulator IDE to
  display the signals of interest in the waveform viewer, as well as the
  scopes and objects of interest. During the debug process you may discover
  issues with your code or test bench, make corrections to your design,
  recompile and relaunch the simulator.

  This command lets you recompile the design, and relaunch the simulator
  while preserving the current Vivado simulator configuration, such as open
  waveform and code windows, Scopes and Objects window settings.

  Note: The relaunch_sim command applies only to simulations running in the
  Vivado Design Suite IDE, not stand-alone or batch Vivado simulator runs.

  This command returns a transcript of its process, or returns an error if it
  fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following command relaunches the current simulation:

    relaunch_sim
