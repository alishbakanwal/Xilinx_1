Description:

  Creates a wave divider in the wave form viewer. The wave divider can be
  used to separate groups of related objects, for easier viewing.

  The wave divider can be added into a specified or current waveform
  configuration at the specified location. If no location is specified the
  wave divider is inserted at the end of the waveform configuration.

  This command returns the name of the newly-created wave divider.

  Note: This command can only be used when running a simulation.

Arguments:

  -into <wcfgGroupVbusObj> - (Optional) Specifies the wave configuration,
  group, or virtual bus into which the new wave object(s) are inserted. If
  <wcfgGroupVbusObj> is a string instead of an object, it is treated as the
  name of a group in the current WCFG. If no such group is found, the tool
  searches the names of the virtual buses of the current WCFG. If still not
  found, the tool searches the names of all WCFG objects. If no -into object
  is specified, the current wave configuration is assumed.

  -at_wave <waveObj> - (Optional) Adds a wave divider at a specified wave
  object. If <waveObj> is a string, it is treated as the display name of a
  wave object.

  -after_wave <waveObj> - (Optional) Adds a wave divider after a specified
  wave object. If <waveObj> is a string, it is treated as the display name of
  a wave object.

  -before_wave <waveObj> - (Optional) Adds a wave divider before a specified
  wave object. If <waveObj> is a string, it is treated as the display name of
  a wave object.

  -color <arg> - (Optional) Sets the color property of the new wave object(s)
  to a pre-defined color name or a color specified by a six-digit RGB format
  (RRGGBB).

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Optional) Creates a divider with the specified display name. The
  default name is new_divider.

Examples:

  The following example inserts a wave divider named Div1, after the CLK wave
  object:

    add_wave_divider -after_wave CLK Div1
