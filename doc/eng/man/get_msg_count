Description:

  Gets the number of messages, of a specific severity or message ID, that
  have been returned by the tool since it was invoked.

  Every message delivered by the tool has a unique global message ID that
  consists of an application sub-system code and a message identifier. This
  results in a message ID that looks like the following:

    "Common 17-54" 
    "Netlist 29-28" 
    "Synth 8-3295"

  This command can give you an idea of how close to the message limit the
  tool may be getting. You can check the current message limit with the
  get_msg_limit command. You can change the message limit with the
  set_msg_limit command.

  By default this command returns the message count for all messages. You can
  also get the count of a specific severity of message, or for a specific
  message ID.

Arguments:

  -severity <value> - (Optional) Specifies the severity of the message. There
  are five message severities:

   *  ERROR - An ERROR condition implies an issue has been encountered which
      will render design results unusable and cannot be resolved without user
      intervention.

   *  {CRITICAL WARNING} - A CRITICAL WARNING message indicates that certain
      input/constraints will either not be applied or are outside the best
      practices for a FPGA family. User action is strongly recommended.

      Note: Since this is a two word value, it must be enclosed in {} or "".

   *  WARNING - A WARNING message indicates that design results may be
      sub-optimal because constraints or specifications may not be applied as
      intended. User action may be taken or may be reserved.

   *  INFO - An INFO message is the same as a STATUS message, but includes a
      severity and message ID tag. An INFO message includes a message ID to
      allow further investigation through answer records if needed.

   *  STATUS - A STATUS message communicates general status of the process
      and feedback to the user regarding design processing. A STATUS message
      does not include a message ID.

  -id <value> - (Optional) The message ID is found in the tool in the
  Messages view or other reports when the message is reported. Use the
  specific message ID to get the count for that message.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example gets the message count for all messages:

    get_msg_count -severity ALL 
    get_msg_count

  Note: Both lines return the same thing since the default is to return the
  count for all messages when -severity or -id is not specified.

  The following example gets the message count of the specified message ID:

    get_msg_count -id "Netlist 29-28"
