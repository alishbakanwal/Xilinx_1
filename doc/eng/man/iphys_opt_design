Description:

  The iphys_opt_design command describes a specific optimization that was
  performed by the phys_opt_design command, such as replicating a critical
  cell or pulling registers from a block RAM to improve critical path delay.
  The iphys_opt_design command includes all the information necessary to
  recreate both the post-optimization logical netlist and the placement
  changes required for the optimized netlist.

  Interactive physical optimization can be used in two ways:

   *  Applying post-placement physical optimizations to the pre-placement
      netlist to improve the overall placement result and improve design
      performance.

   *  Saving the physical optimizations in a Tcl script to be repeated as
      needed.

  The various optimizations performed by phys_opt_design can be written to an
  iphys_opt Tcl script by write_iphys_opt_tcl , and read into the design by
  the read_iphys_opt_tcl command.

  Note: The iphys_opt_design command is intended for use inside the iphys_opt
  Tcl script file. These commands can be edited in the context of the
  iphys_opt Tcl script, but they are not intended to be specified at the
  command line.

  This command returns a transcript of its processes, or an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -fanout_opt - (Optional) Performs delay-driven optimization on the
  specified net, by replicating drivers to reduce delay.

  -critical_cell_opt - (Optional) Replicate cells on specified nets to reduce
  delays.

  -placement_opt - (Optional) Move cells to reduce delay on specified nets.

  -rewire - (Optional) Refactor logic cones to reduce logic levels and reduce
  delay on critical signals.

  -net <arg> - (Optional) Specify the net to apply an optimization to.

  -cluster <args> - (Optional) Specify a cluster of load pins.

  -place_cell <args> - (Optional) Place the specified cells, or cells
  connected to the specified pins, on the device sites specified.

  -place - (Optional) Replay placement of the transformation.

  -dsp_register_opt - (Optional) Improve critical path delay by moving
  registers from slices to DSP blocks, or from DSP blocks to slices.

  -bram_register_opt - (Optional) Improve critical path delay by moving
  registers from slices to block RAMs, or from block RAMs to slices.

  -shift_register_opt - (Optional) Perform shift register optimization to
  improve timing on negative slack paths between shift register cells (SRLs)
  and other logic cells.

  -cell <arg> - (Optional) Specify a cell to apply an optimization to.

  -packing - (Optional) Packing in DSP/BRAM.

  -unpacking - (Optional) Unpacking in DSP/BRAM.

  -port <arg> - (Optional) Specify a port on a cell to apply the optimization
  to.

  -critical_pin_opt - For LUT inputs, this optimization performs remapping of
  logical pins to physical pins, also known as pin-swapping, to improve
  critical path timing.

  -skipped_optimization - (Optional) Defines the specified optimization as
  not performed. These are optimizations identified by phys_opt_design that
  are skipped because suitable locations for optimized logic cannot be found.
  For example, BRAM register optimizations to improve slack that are skipped
  because no suitable locations can be found for the registers.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example performs a critical cell optimization on the
  specified net and cluster of ports:

    iphys_opt_design -critical_cell_opt -net \ 
       {ADUR_CORE_INST/CPE_INST/CPE_ANT_RESOURCE_TDM_INST0 \ 
       /CPE_ANT_LINE_IQ_TDM_ANT0_INST/CPE_PN_MULT_INST/CPE_PN_MUL_INST3 \ 
       /Q_PNI_MULT_INST/pn_mult_reg[3][0]} \ 
       -cluster {pn_mult[3]_i_14_replica  {\ 
       {ADUR_CORE_INST/CPE_INST/CPE_ANT_RESOURCE_TDM_INST0 \ 
       /CPE_ANT_LINE_IQ_TDM_ANT0_INST/CPE_PN_MULT_INST/CPE_PN_MUL_INST2 \ 
       /Q_ADD_INST/pn_mult_reg[3]_i_6_CARRY8/S[0]}}}\ 
       -cluster {pn_mult[3]_i_14_replica_1  {\ 
       {ADUR_CORE_INST/CPE_INST/CPE_ANT_RESOURCE_TDM_INST0 \ 
       /CPE_ANT_LINE_IQ_TDM_ANT0_INST/CPE_PN_MULT_INST/CPE_PN_MUL_INST0 \ 
       /Q_ADD_INST/pn_mult_reg[3]_i_10_CARRY8/S[0]}}}\

  The following example performs a shift register optimization on the
  specified cell:

    iphys_opt_design -shift_register_opt -cell \ 
       {ADUR_CORE_INST/EMIF_INTERFACE_INST/EMIF_HOST_IF_INST/DLY_INST1 \ 
       /PD_INST_FPGA/delay_chain_reg[9][16]_srl9} -port D
