Description:

  Connects a signal from the netlist design to a port on an ILA debug core
  that was added to the design using the create_debug_core command. The
  signal can either be connected to a specific channel index on the port, or
  simply connected to an available channel on the port.

  If you try to connect too many signals to a port, or there are not enough
  channels to support the connection, the tool will return an error.

  Additional ports can be added to a debug core through the use of the
  create_debug_port command, and you can increase the available channels on
  an existing port with the set_property port_width command. See the examples
  below.

  You can disconnect signals from ports using the disconnect_debug_port
  command.

  When the debug core has been defined and connected, you can implement the
  debug core as a block for inclusion in the netlist design. Use the
  implement_debug_core command to implement the core.

Arguments:

  -channel_start_index <arg> - (Optional) The channel index to use for the
  connection. If more than one signal has been specified, this is the channel
  index where connections will start to be added. Channel indexes are
  numbered starting at 0.

  Note: If this argument is not specified, the tool will place connections on
  the first available channel index.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <port> - (Required) The name of the port to connect signals to. The port
  must be referenced by the core_name/port_name.

  <nets> - (Required) A list of one or more net names from the netlist design
  to connect to the specified debug port.

Examples:

  The following example creates a new PROBE port on the myCore debug core,
  increases the PORT_WIDTH property of the port in order to prepare it to
  receive the number of signals to be connected, and connects signals to the
  port starting at the third channel position (index 2).

    create_debug_port myCore PROBE 
    set_property PORT_WIDTH 8 [get_debug_ports myCore/PROBE1] 
    connect_debug_port myCore/PROBE1 [get_nets [list m0_ack_o m0_cyc_i \ 
       m0_err_o m0_rty_o m0_stb_i m0_we_i ]] -channel_start_index 2

  Note: If you specify too many nets to connect to the available channels on
  the port, the tool will return an error and will not connect the ports.
