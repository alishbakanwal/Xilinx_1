Description:

  Report the control sets of the current design.

  Control sets are the list of control signals (Clock, CE, SR) for SLICE
  registers and LUTs. Registers must belong to the same control set in order
  to be packed into the same device resource. Registers without a control
  signal cannot be packed into devices with registers having control signals.
  A high number of control sets can cause difficulty fitting the device and
  can cause routing congestion and timing issues.

  By default the report_control_sets command returns an abbreviated report
  indicating only the number of unique control sets. However, the -verbose
  arguments returns a detailed report of all control sets, for either the
  whole design or for the specified cells.

Arguments:

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file. The
  specified file will be overwritten if one already exists.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -sort_by <args> - (Optional) Sort the detailed report generated by the
  -verbose argument according to the specified criteria. Valid sort criteria
  are: clk, clkEn, and set.

  Note: The -sort_by argument is used with -verbose.

  -cells <args> - (Optional) Report control sets for the specified cell
  objects.

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string rather than
  to the standard output. The Tcl string can be captured by a variable
  definition and parsed or otherwise processed.

  Note: This argument cannot be used with the -file option.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example reports the control sets of the current design,
  sorted by the clk and clkEn signals:

    report_control_sets -verbose -sort_by {clk clkEn}

  The following example reports the control sets of the specified cells,
  sorted by clk and set:

    report_control_sets -verbose -sort_by {clk set} -cells [get_cells usb*]
