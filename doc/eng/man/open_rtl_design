Description:

  Opens a new or existing RTL source design.

  Note: Verilog or VHDL source files must be added to the source fileset, and
  a top module identified, before opening an RTL design.

Arguments:

  -name <arg> - The name of a new or existing RTL design.

  -part <arg> - The Xilinx device to use when creating a new design. If the
  part is not specified the default part will be used.

  -constrset <arg> - The name of the constraint fileset to use when opening
  the design.

  Note: The -constrset argument must refer to a constraint fileset that
  exists. It cannot be used to create a new fileset. Use create_fileset for
  that purpose.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following creates a new RTL design called RTL1:

    open_rtl_design -name RTL1

  Note: The default source set, constraint set, and part will be used in this
  case.

  The following example opens an existing RTL design called RTL1, and
  specifies the constraint set to be used:

    
    open_rtl_design -name RTL1 -constrset top

  Note: The default source set and part will be used in this case.
