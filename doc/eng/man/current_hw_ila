Description:

  Set or return the current hardware ILA debug core targeted by the Hardware
  Manager in the Vivado Design Suite for programming and debug.

  The Integrated Logic Analyzer (ILA) debug core lets you perform in-system
  debug of implemented designs, or design bitstreams, on a programmed Xilinx
  FPGA device. The ILA core includes many advanced features of modern logic
  analyzers, including boolean trigger equations, and edge transition
  triggers. You can use the ILA core to probe specific signals of the design,
  to trigger on programmed hardware events, and capture data from the Xilinx
  FPGA device in real-time. Refer to LogiCORE IP Integrated Logic Analyzer
  (PG172) for details of the ILA core.

  ILA debug cores can be added to a design instantiating an ILA core from the
  IP catalog into the RTL design, or using the create_debug_core command to
  add the ILA core to the synthesized netlist. Refer to Vivado Design Suite
  User Guide: Programming and Debugging (UG908) for more information on
  adding ILA debug cores to the design.

  After generating a bitstream from the design, and programming the device
  with the program_hw_devices command, the ILA debug cores in the design are
  accessible from the Hardware Manager using the get_hw_ilas command. The
  debug probes assigned to the ILA debug cores in the design can be returned
  with the get_hw_probes command.

  This command returns the current hardware ILA core as an object, or returns
  an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_ila> - (Optional) Specify the hw_ila object to set as the current debug
  core for programming and debug. The hw_ila must be specified as an object
  as returned by the get_hw_ilas command. If a ILA debug core is not
  specified, the current hw_ila will be returned.

Example:

  The following example returns the current hardware ILA debug core:

    current_hw_ila
