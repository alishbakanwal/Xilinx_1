Description:

  Set or return the current hardware cfgmem object.

  The process whereby the design specific data is loaded or programmed into
  the Xilinx<tm tmtype="reg"/> FPGA is called configuration. The
  create_hw_cfgmem command defines a flash memory device used for configuring
  and booting the FPGA device.

  When a new hw_cfgmem object is created, it becomes the current hw_cfgmem
  object. You can use the current_hw_cfgmem to return the current hw_cfgmem
  object, or you can specify a hw_cfgmem object, as returned by
  get_hw_cfgmems, to change the current object.

  After the hw_cfgmem object is created, and associated with the hw_device,
  the configuration memory can be programmed with the bitstream and other
  data from a memory configuration file created with the write_cfgmem
  command.

  The hw_cfgmem object is programmed using the program_hw_cfgmem command.

  This command returns the current hardware cfgmem as an object, or returns
  an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -hw_device <arg> - (Required) Specify the hw_device object to set the
  current_hw_cfgmem on. The hw_device must be specified as an object as
  returned by the current_hw_device or get_hw_devices commands.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_cfgmem> - (Optional) Specify the hw_cfgmem object to use as the current
  configuration memory for programming and debug. The hw_cfgmem must be
  specified as an object as returned by the get_hw_cfgmems command.

Example:

  The following example returns the current hardware cfgmem object:

    current_hw_cfgmem
