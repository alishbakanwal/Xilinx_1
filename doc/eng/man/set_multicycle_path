Description:

  By default, the Vivado timing engine performs a single-cycle analysis, in
  which the setup check is performed at the destination on the capture edge,
  one clock cycle after the edge of the source clock. However, this may not
  be appropriate for certain timing paths. The most common example is a logic
  path that requires more than one clock cycle for the data to stabilize at
  the endpoint.

  The set_multicycle_path command lets you choose a path multiplier, N, to
  establish a timing path that takes N clock cycles from the start clock edge
  to the capture clock edge. The path multiplier defines the total number of
  clock cycles required for propagation of a signal from its origin to
  destination when that propagation is longer than a single clock cycle. For
  more information on the use of this command, refer to the Vivado Design
  Suite User Guide: Using Constraints (UG903) .

  The set_multicycle_path command is used to specify path multipliers for
  setup and hold analysis, for rising and/or falling edges, with respect to
  the source clock or the destination clock. This command includes three
  elements:

   *  The specification of the setup and hold analysis affected by the
      multicycle path.

   *  The definition of the timing paths to which the multicycle path applies.

   *  The path multiplier defining the number of clock cycles to apply to the
      timing analysis.

  By default the path multiplier applies to both the setup and hold analysis.
  The hold analysis is derived from the setup analysis, so it is moved along
  with the setup analysis. If the path multiplier moves the setup check N
  clock cycles, it moves the hold check N-1 clock cycles. However, this often
  results in hold timing failures.

  You can use a second set_multicycle_path command with the -hold option to
  restore the hold analysis to its original location. When the -hold option
  is specified the <path_multiplier> acts on the hold relationship to restore
  the hold check to its original position. For instance, the following
  command sequence extends the setup check for 3 clock cycles, and
  consequently extends the hold check by two clock cycles (N-1). The second
  command restores the hold check to its original position:

    set_multicycle_path 3 -from {usbEngine1/u4/csr_reg[26]/C} \ 
    -to {usbEngine1/u1/u2/sizd_c_reg[12]/D} 
    set_multicycle_path 2 -from {usbEngine1/u4/csr_reg[26]/C} \ 
    -to {usbEngine1/u1/u2/sizd_c_reg[12]/D} -hold

  By default, the setup path multiplier is applied with respect to the
  destination clock, and the hold path multiplier is applied with respect to
  the source clock. Use the -start or -end options to change the default
  setup or hold analysis with respect to the source or destination clocks.

  This command operates silently when successful, or returns an error if the
  command fails.

Arguments:

  -setup - (Optional) Apply the path multiplier to the setup check, which
  also affects the hold check. This is also the default behavior of the
  set_multicycle_path command when neither -setup nor -hold are specified.

  -hold - (Optional) Apply the path multiplier only to the hold check, to
  change the hold relationship by the specified number of clock cycles.

  Note: When neither -setup nor -hold is used, or when only -setup is
  specified, the <path_multiplier> applies to both setup and hold checks.

  -rise - (Optional) Apply the multiplier specifically to rising edge delays
  on the path endpoint.

  -fall - (Optional) Apply the multiplier specifically to falling edge delays
  on the path endpoint.

  Note: If neither -rise or -fall is specified, the multiplier is applied to
  both the rising and falling edge delays.

  -start - (Optional) By default, the setup path multiplier is defined with
  respect to the destination clock (-end ). To modify the setup requirement
  with respect to the source clock, the -start option must be used.

  -end - (Optional) By default, the hold path multiplier is defined with
  respect to the source clock. To modify the hold requirement with respect to
  the destination clock, the -end option must be used.

  Note: The -start/-end options have no effect when applying a multicycle
  path constraint on paths clocked by the same clock, or clocked by two
  clocks having the same waveform, or with no phase shift.

  -reset_path - (Optional) Reset the specified path before applying the
  multicycle path multiplier.

  -from <args> - (Optional) A list of start points on the path that will be
  affected by the path multiplier.

  -rise_from <args> - (Optional) A list of the start points on the
  rising-edge path that will be affected by the multicycle path multiplier.

  -fall_from <args> - (Optional) A list of the start points on the
  falling-edge path that will be affected by the multicycle path multiplier.

  -to <args> - (Optional) A list of the end points on the path that will be
  affected by the multicycle path multiplier.

  -rise_to <args> - (Optional) A list of the end points on the rising-edge
  path that will be affected by the multicycle path multiplier.

  -fall_to <args> - (Optional) A list of the end points on the falling-edge
  path that will be affected by the multicycle path multiplier.

  -through <args> - (Optional) A list of pins, cell, or nets through which
  the path affected by the multicycle path multiplier travels.

  -rise_through <args> - (Optional) A list of pins, cell, or nets through
  which the rising-edge path affected by the multicycle path multiplier
  travels.

  -fall_through <args> - (Optional) Specifies the list of pins, cell, or nets
  through which the falling-edge path affected by the multicycle path
  multiplier travels.

  Note: Although -to, -through, and -from (in their various forms) are all
  optional arguments, at least one -from, -to , or -through argument must be
  specified to define a timing path for the set_multicycle_path constraint,
  or an error will be returned.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <path_multiplier> - (Required) The number of clock cycles to move the setup
  and hold analysis analysis.

  Note: When -hold is specified, the <path_multiplier> acts on the hold
  relationship to restore the hold check to its original position.

Examples:

  The following example establishes a path multiplier of 3 clock cycles for
  the setup check of the timing path defined by the -from/ -to options. A
  path multiplier of N-1, or 2 in this example, is used to decrement the hold
  check on the same timing path:

    
    set_multicycle_path 3 -setup -from [get_pins data0_reg/C] \ 
       -to [get_pins data1_reg/D] 
    set_multicycle_path 2 -hold -from [get_pins data0_reg/C] \ 
       -to [get_pins data1_reg/D]

  Note: For more information on the relationship between the setup and hold
  analysis refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Using Constraints
  (UG903).
