Description:

  Writes data samples from the specified hw_probe object on the current hw_ila.

  The number of captured samples returned from the specified probe is equal
  to the DATA_DEPTH property of the ILA core. The default data depth is 1024
  samples. Data values are returned in the radix specified for the hw_probe,
  as determined by the DISPLAY_RADIX property.

  Note: For any samples to be returned, data must have been captured by the
  specified port.

  The values are listed to the standard output, or can be captured to a Tcl
  variable for post-processing, or output to a file.

  The following is an example Tcl script that lists the data samples from
  hw_probes of interest:

    # Define a list of probes to get the data samples from 
    set probeList [get_hw_probes *AR*] 
    #Specify the radix for the return values 
    set_property DISPLAY_RADIX BINARY [get_hw_probes *AR*] 
    # Define a filename to write data to 
    set fileName C:/Data/probeData1.txt 
    # Open the specified file in write mode 
    set FH [open $fileName w] 
    # Write probe data for each probe 
    foreach x $probeList {  
       puts $FH "$x:" 
       puts $FH [list_hw_samples $x]  
    }  
    # Close the output file 
    close $FH 
    puts "Probe data written to $fileName\n"

  This command returns the requested output, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_probe> - List the data samples for the specified hw_probe on the
  current hw_ila. The probe must be specified as an object returned by the
  get_hw_probes command.

Examples:

  The following example returns the data samples for the specified probe:

    list_hw_samples [get_hw_probes *probe18]
