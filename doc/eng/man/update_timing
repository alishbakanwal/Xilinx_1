Description:

  Updates timing for the current design.

  Update the timing data to reflect any timing constraints that were added to
  the design since the timing engine was last run. This command updates the
  in-memory view of the timing database, without incurring the time of a full
  timing analysis.

  Timing is automatically updated by commands that change timing or need
  updated timing information, such as the report_timing command. The
  update_timing command lets you manually trigger the timing update to insure
  the latest constraints are applied to the timing engine.

  The update_timing command uses an incremental analysis approach by default,
  which updates only out-of-date information, to reduce process and analysis
  time. You can also specify a complete or full update to insure a
  comprehensive review of timing data in the design. However, to avoid long
  timing analysis run times, you should use the -full option only when you
  need to.

Arguments:

  -full - (Optional) Perform a complete timing analysis rather than the
  default incremental update of the timing data.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example performs a full update of the in-memory timing data:

    update_timing -full
