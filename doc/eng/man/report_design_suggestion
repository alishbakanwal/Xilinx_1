Description:

  Report suggested Vivado tool options to improve design performance. This
  reporting command analyzes the design to check for certain known and
  problematic structures, and checks design performance against design
  metrics. Tool options and strategies are recommended based on the results.

  Recommendations fall into three categories:

   *  Design suggestions

   *  Synthesis suggestions

   *  Implementation suggestions

  Note: By default the report is written to the Tcl console or STD output.
  However, the results can also be written to a file or returned as a string
  if desired.

Arguments:

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file. The
  specified file will be overwritten if one already exists.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string rather than
  to the standard output. The Tcl string can be captured by a variable
  definition and parsed or otherwise processed.

  -write_synth_options_tcl <arg> - (Optional) Specifies a file to write a Tcl
  script containing the synthesis suggestions.

  -write_impl_options_tcl <arg> - (Optional) Specifies a file to write a Tcl
  script containing the implementation suggestions.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example reports design suggestions, and save the synthesis
  suggestions to the specified file:

    report_design_suggestion -file C:/Data/design_suggestions.txt \ 
    -write_synth_options_tcl C:/Data/run_synthesis_suggestions.tcl
