Description:

  Change the part used by the current project for subsequent elaboration,
  synthesis, implementation, and analysis.

  Note: The part is changed for the current project only, and not for the
  in-memory design. You can change the speed grade of the device in the
  in-memory design for timing analysis using the set_speed_grade command. You
  can change the part used when opening an existing design checkpoint using
  the -part option of the open_checkpoint or read_checkpoint commands.

  This command is provided to let you change the part for the in-memory
  project of non-project based designs, and does not support project-based
  designs. For a project-based design set the PART property on the project as
  follows:

    set_property PART xc7vx485tffg1158-2 [current_project]

  Use the get_parts command to get a list of the available parts.

  The set_part command creates an in-memory project for a non-project based
  design, or assigns the part to the existing in-memory project.

  Note: For a discussion of Project Mode and Non-Project Mode refer to the
  Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Design Flows Overview (UG892).

  This command returns the part that the in-memory project is set to use, or
  returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <part> - (Required) Specifies the part to change to, or use in the current
  project or in-memory design.

Example:

  The following example changes the part of the current in-memory project:

    set_part xc7vx485tffg1158-2
