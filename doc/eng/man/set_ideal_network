Description:

  Sets a network as an ideal network rather than a propagated network.

  Note: This command operates silently and does not return direct feedback of
  its operation.

Arguments:

  -no_propagate - (Optional) Do not propogate this network through logic gates.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - A list of ports or pins on which to act.

Examples:

  The following example defines the networks from all input ports as ideal
  networks:

    set_ideal_network [all_inputs]
