Description:

  Report the utilization of resources on the target part by the current
  synthesized or implemented design. The report is returned to the standard
  output, unless the -file, -return_string, or -name arguments are specified.

  Note: Though resource utilization can be reported early in the design
  process, the report will be more accurate as the design progresses from
  synthesis through implementation.

  This command returns the requested information, or returns an error if it
  fails.

Arguments:

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file. The
  specified file will be overwritten if one already exists, unless -append is
  also specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -pblocks <arg> - (Optional) Report the resources utilized by one or more
  Pblocks in the design.

  Note: -pblocks can not be used with the -name option.

  -cells <arg> - (Optional) Report the resources utilized by one or more
  hierarchical cells in the current design.

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string rather than
  to the standard output. The Tcl string can be captured by a variable
  definition and parsed or otherwise processed.

  Note: This argument cannot be used with the -file option.

  -slr - (Optional) Reports the utilization for each separate SLR in devices
  having SLRs.

  -packthru - (Optional) Reports LUTs used for route through purposes. This
  appears in the utilization report as "LUTs used exclusively as
  route-thrus".

  -name <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the name of the results to output to the
  GUI.

  -no_primitives - (Optional) Remove the Primitives section from the report.
  The Primitives section reports the number and type of logic primitives used
  on the device.

  -omit_locs - (Optional) Omit the LOCed column from the report. The LOCed
  column reports the quantity of logic elements that have been placed onto
  the fabric of the device.

  -hierarchical - (Optional) Reports the utilization of the device broken
  down according to the hierarchy of the design.

  -hierarchical_depth <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the depth of the hierarchy
  to report when reporting utilization according to the hierarchy. The
  default depth is 0, which means that -hierarchical will only report the
  top-level by default.

  -hierarchical_percentages - (Optional) Specifies that utilization data in
  the hierarchical report be reported as percentages.

  -spreadsheet_file <arg> - (Optional) Export utilization tables to the
  specified XLSX format spreadsheet. The ability to export a spreadsheet file
  is only available when the -name option is also specified and the report is
  generated in the GUI.

  Note: You should specify the .xlsx suffix for the specified file, as it is
  not automatically assigned. If the path is not specified as part of the
  file name, the file will be written into the current working directory,
  which may be the directory from which the Vivado tool was launched.

  -spreadsheet_table <arg> - (Optional) Specify a utilization table to export
  to the spreadsheet file. The default is to export the Hierarchy table for
  the whole design. This options requires the use of -spreadsheet_file. The
  table name is displayed in the Report Utilization window when a specific
  table is selected from the tree view. Some example table names are:

   *  "Hierarchy"

   *  "Slice Logic Distribution"

   *  "Slice Logic Distribution - LUT as Memory"

   *  "Slice Logic Distribution - LUT as Memory - LUT as Distributed RAM"

   *  "Slice Logic Distribution - LUT as Memory - LUT as Shift Register"

   *  "Slice Logic Distribution - LUT as Logic"

   *  "Slice Logic - F8 Muxes"

   *  "Slice Logic - Slice Registers"

   *  "Slice Logic - Slice Registers - Registers as AND/OR"

   *  "Memory - Block RAM Tile"

   *  "Memory - Block RAM Tile - RAMB18"

   *  "DSP - DSPs"

   *  "Clocking - BUFGCTRL"

   *  "Specific Feature - BSCANE2"

   *  "Primitives"

  -spreadsheet_depth <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the hierarchical depth,
  starting from the top-level of the design, to export to the spreadsheet
  file. The default value is 8. This options requires the use of
  -spreadsheet_file.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example reports the resources collectively utilized by all
  the Pblocks in the design, and writes the results to the specified file:

    report_utilization -pblocks [get_pblocks] -file C:/Data/pblocks_util.txt

  This example reports the utilization for the whole design to the named
  report in the GUI, but exports the "Clocking - BUFGCTRL" table to the
  specified spreadsheet file:

    report_utilization -name utilization_1 -spreadsheet_file util_table.xlsx \ 
    -spreadsheet_table "Clocking - BUFGCTRL"

  The following example reports the resources utilized by each Pblock in the
  design, appending the report for each Pblock to a single specified file:

    foreach x [get_pblocks] { 
      puts "Reporting Pblock: $x ----------------------------------" 
      report_utilization -append -file C:/Data/pblocks_util.txt -pblocks $x 
    }
