Description:

  Reset the trigger and capture configuration properties on the specified ILA
  debug core, and the TRIGGER_COMPARE_VALUE and CAPTURE_COMPARE_VALUE
  properties on the core`s debug probes.

  Properties of the hw_ila object are configured with the set_property
  command in preparation for the run_hw_ila command to configure the ILA core
  on the hw_device. This command restores the user-configurable properties on
  the specified hw_ila to their default settings. Refer to the Vivado Design
  Suite User Guide: Programming and Debugging (UG908) for more information on
  these properties.

  The default properties are:

   *  CONTROL.DATA_DEPTH is set to the MAX_DATA_DEPTH of the hw_ila object.

   *  CONTROL.TRIGGER_POSITION 0

   *  CONTROL.WINDOW_COUNT 1

   *  CONTROL.TRIGGER_MODE BASIC_ONLY

   *  CONTROL.TRIGGER_CONDITION AND

   *  CONTROL.TRIG_OUT_MODE DISABLED

   *  CONTROL.CAPTURE_MODE ALWAYS

   *  CONTROL.CAPTURE_CONDITION AND

   *  TRIGGER_COMPARE_VALUE eq1`bX (on the hw_probes)

   *  CAPTURE_COMPARE_VALUE eq1`bX (on the hw_probes)

  This command operates silently, returning nothing if successful, or
  returning an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -reset_compare_values [ true | false ] - (Optional) Reset the
  TRIGGER_COMPARE_VALUE and CAPTURE_COMPARE_VALUE properties on the hw_probes
  associated with the specified hw_ila object. This is a boolean argument
  that is TRUE, or enabled, by default. If -reset_compare_values false is
  used, the compare value properties on the probes are not reset. In this
  case, the properties on the hw_ila are reset, but the properties on the
  hw_probes are left as currently configured.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_ilas> - (Optional) Specify one or more hw_ila objects to reset. The
  hw_ila objects can either be specified as objects returned by the
  get_hw_ilas or current_hw_ila commands, or specified by name. If the hw_ila
  is not specified, the current_hw_ila will be reset.

Example:

  The following example resets all hw_ila debug cores on the current device:

    reset_hw_ila [get_hw_ilas]
