Description:

  Write a Verilog netlist of the current design or from a specific cell of
  the design to the specified file or directory. The output is a IEEE
  1364-2001 compliant Verilog HDL file that contains netlist information
  obtained from the input design files.

  You can output a complete netlist of the design or specific cell, or output
  a port list for the design, or a Verilog netlist for simulation or static
  timing analysis.

Arguments:

  -cell <arg> - (Optional) Write the Verilog netlist from a specified cell or
  block level of the design hierarchy. The output Verilog file or files will
  only include information contained within the specified cell or module.

  -mode <arg> - (Optional) The mode to use when writing the Verilog file. By
  default, the Verilog netlist is written for the whole design. Valid mode
  values are:

   *  design - Output a Verilog netlist for the whole design. This acts as a
      snapshot of the design, including all post placement, implementation,
      and routing information in the netlist.

   *  pin_planning - Output only the I/O ports for the top-level of the design.

   *  synth_stub - Output the ports from the top-level of the design for use
      as a synthesis stub.

   *  sta - Output a Verilog netlist to be used for static timing analysis
      (STA).

   *  funcsim - Output a Verilog netlist to be used for functional
      simulation. The output netlist is not suitable for synthesis.

   *  timesim - Output a Verilog netlist to be used for timing simulation.
      The output netlist is not suitable for synthesis.

  -lib - (Optional) Create a separate Verilog file for each library used by
  the design.

  Note: The -library option can only be used for simulation. Vivado synthesis
  will treat all Verilog files as being in the default work library.

  -port_diff_buffers - (Optional) Add the differential pair buffers and
  internal wires associated with those buffers into the output ports list.
  This argument is only valid when -mode pin_planning or -mode synth_stub is
  specified.

  -write_all_overrides [ true | false ] - (Optional) Write parameter
  overrides, in the design to the Verilog output even if the value of the
  parameter is the same as the defined primitive default value. If the option
  is false then parameter values which are equivalent to the primitive
  defaults are not output to the Verilog file. Setting this option to true
  will not change the result but makes the output Verilog more verbose.

  -keep_vcc_gnd - (Optional) By default, when writing a nelist for
  simulation, or from an IP Integrator block design, the Vivado Design Suite
  replaces VCC and GND primitives, and the nets they drive, with literal
  constants on each of the loads on the net. The -keep_vcc_gnd option
  disables this default behavior and preserves the VCC or GND primitives.

  -rename_top <arg> - (Optional) Rename the top module in the output as
  specified. This option only works with -mode funcsim or -mode timesim to
  allow the Verilog netlist to plug into top-level simulation test benches.

  -sdf_anno [ true | false ] - (Optional) Add the $sdf_annotate statement to
  the Verilog netlist. Valid values are true (or 1) and false (or 0). This
  option only works with -mode timesim, and is set to false by default.

  -sdf_file <arg> - (Optional) The path and filename of the SDF file to use
  when writing the $sdf_annotate statement into the output Verilog file. When
  not specified, the SDF file is assumed to have the same name and path as
  the Verilog output specified by <file>, with a file extension of .sdf. The
  SDF file must be separately written to the specified file path and name
  using the write_sdf command.

  -force - (Optional) Overwrite the Verilog files if they already exists.

  -include_xilinx_libs - (Optional) Write the simulation models directly in
  the output netlist file rather than pointing to the libraries by reference.

  -logic_function_stripped - (Optional) Hides the INIT values for LUTs & RAMs
  by converting them to fixed values in order to create a netlist for debug
  purposes that will not behave properly in simulation or synthesis.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - (Required) The path and filename of the Verilog file to write. The
  path is optional, but if one is not provided the Verilog file will be
  written to the current working directory, or the directory from which the
  Vivado tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example writes a Verilog simulation netlist file for the
  whole design to the specified file and path:

    write_verilog C:/Data/my_verilog.v

  In the following example, because the -mode timesim and -sdf_anno options
  are specified, the $sdf_annotate statement will be added to the Verilog
  netlist. However, since the -sdf_file option is not specified, the SDF file
  is assumed to have the same name as the Verilog output file, with an .sdf
  file extension:

    write_verilog C:/Data/my_verilog.net -mode timesim -sdf_anno true

  Note: The SDF filename written to the $sdf_annotate statement will be
  my_verilog.sdf.

  In the following example, the functional simulation mode is specified, the
  option to keep VCC and GND primitives in the output simulation netlist is
  enabled, and the output file is specified:

    write_verilog -mode funcsim -keep_vcc_gnd out.v
