Description:

  Return the current scope in the current simulation, or set the current
  scope to the specified HDL scope.

  The current_scope command returns the name of the current simulation scope.

  If <hdl_scope> is supplied then, the current scope is set to the specified
  scope.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hdl_scope> - (Optional) Specify an HDL scope to assign as the current
  scope of the current simulation. The scope can be specified as an absolute
  hierarchical path name (such as /tb/UUT), a relative path name (/uut, gt,
  ./gt, uut/fg) of a scope, or an HDL scope object, returned by the
  get_scopes command.

  Note: If you specify `/` as the HDL scope, the scope is reset to the
  top-level scope in the current simulation.

Examples:

  The following example sets the current scope to the specified HDL scope:

    current_scope /testbench/dut

  This example returns the current scope name to console:

    current_scope
