Description:

  Read an RPX (protobuf) file into memory to reload report results into the
  Vivado Design Suite. This command requires an open implemented or
  synthesized design.

  The RPX file is written by report commands such as report_timing_summary,
  and report_pulse_width, that support the -rpx option, and is an interactive
  report file that can be reloaded into memory. Reloading the report into
  memory, reconnects the objects in the report to design objects so that
  cross-selection between the report in the Vivado IDE and the design is
  enabled.

  This command returns the report results to the Tcl console by default, or
  when -console is specified, or opens a report window in the Vivado IDE when
  -name is specified. This command returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file. The
  specified file will be overwritten if one already exists, unless -append is
  also specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -console - (Optional) Output the report results to the Tcl console in the
  Vivado IDE or Tcl shell mode. This is the default behavior of the
  open_report command if no other options are specified.

  -name <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the name of the results set for the GUI.
  Timing summary reports in the GUI can be deleted by the
  delete_timing_results command.

  Note: Opening the RPX file in a named window in the VIvado IDE links
  objects between the report and the design for cross-selection.

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string rather than
  to the standard output. The Tcl string can be captured by a variable
  definition and parsed or otherwise processed.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <rpx> - Specify the name of the RPX file to load into memory.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the tool will
  search for the specified file in the current working directory and then in
  the directory from which the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example reads the specified RPX file an opens a named report
  in the Vivado IDE:

    open_report -name RPX1 design1_summary.rpx
