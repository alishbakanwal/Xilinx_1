Description:

  Remove the specified force objects, or force IDs from the current simulation.

  Forces are applied to specific HDL objects using the add_forces command.
  This command removes those forces from the current simulation.

  Note: If there are force/release statements on an HDL object in the test
  bench or module, these statements are overridden by the add_force command.
  When the remove_force command releases these objects to resume their normal
  operation, the Verilog force/release statements resume their effect.

  This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -all - (Optional) Remove all forces from the current simulation.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <ForceObj> - (Optional) Remove only the specified force object or objects.
  The force ID is returned by the add_force command when the force is
  created.

Examples:

  The following example creates a force object using the add_force command,
  and captures the force ID in a Tcl variable, then removes that force
  object:

    set f10 [ add_force reset 1 300 ] 
    remove_forces $f10

  The following example removes all force objects from the current simulation:

    remove_forces -all
