Description:

  Moves files returned by the get_files command from one fileset to another
  while maintaining the properties on the files.

  This command returns the list of files that were moved, or an error if the
  command fails.

Arguments:

  -fileset <arg> - (Optional) The destination fileset to which the specified
  source files should be moved. If no fileset is specified the files are
  moved to the sources_1 fileset by default. An error is returned if the
  specified fileset does not exist.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <files> - (Optional) One or more file objects returned by the get_files
  command.

  Note: You must specify file objects returned by the get_files command, and
  not simply specify file names.

Examples:

  The following example moves the file, top_full.xdc, to the constrs_2 fileset.

    move_files -fileset constrs_2 [get_files top_full.xdc]
