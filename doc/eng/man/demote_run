Description:

  Delete previously promoted partitions so they are no longer available for
  import using design preservation.

  WARNING - This command will delete the specified partition directory and
  data from the hard drive. Be sure this is the desired result prior to
  executing this command.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors

  trapped.
