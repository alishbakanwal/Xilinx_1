Description:

  Creates a wave marker at the specified time and of the specified name in
  the current waveform configuration.

  This command returns nothing.

  Note: This command can only be used when running a simulation.

Arguments:

  -into <wcfg> - (Optional) Specifies the WCFG object into which the new wave
  marker is inserted. If -into is not specified, the wave marker is added to
  the current wave configuration.

  -name <arg> - (Optional) Creates a marker with the specified name. The
  default name is new_marker.

  <time> - (Optional) Is the simulation runtime within the waveform at which
  to set the marker. The default is time 0.

  <unit> - (Optional) Is the time unit. Allowable units are s, ms, us, ns,
  and ps. The default is the time unit used in the specified waveform
  configuration.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  Add a marker to the existing waveform configuration at 500ns:

    add_wave_marker 500 ns
