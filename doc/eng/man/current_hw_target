Description:

  After opening the Hardware Manager in the Vivado Design Suite, and
  connecting to the Xilinx hardware server (hw_server) using the
  connect_hw_server command, you will need to set the hardware target. This
  command sets or returns the current hardware target.

  The hardware target is a system board containing a JTAG chain of one or
  more Xilinx devices that you can program with a bitstream file, or use to
  debug your design. Connections between hardware targets on the system board
  and the Vivado Design Suite are managed by the hw_server object. Refer to
  Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Programming and Debugging (UG908) for a
  list of supported JTAG download cables and devices.

  The available hardware targets are defined when the Vivado tools Hardware
  Manager is connected to a hw_server. You can return a list of the available
  hardware targets using the get_hw_targets command, and define the current
  hardware target using the current_hw_target command.

  If the <hw_target> is specified as part of the current_hw_target command,
  the specified target is defined as the current hardware target and that
  object is returned. If no hardware target is specified, the
  current_hw_target command returns the current hardware target object.

  Each hardware target can have one or more Xilinx devices to program, or to
  use for debugging purposes. The current device is specified or returned by
  the current_hw_device command. After specifying the current hardware
  target, you can open the connection through the hardware target, to the
  Xilinx device using the open _hw_target command.

  Note: You can use the current_hw_server, current_hw_target, and
  current_hw_device commands to set the hardware for programming and
  debugging the design. You should exercise care when using these commands to
  insure that the current server, target, and device are in sync. The current
  device should be found on the current target, which should be found on the
  current server.

  This command returns the current hardware target as an object, or returns
  an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_target> - (Optional) Specify the hw_target object to set as the
  current_hw_target for programming and debug. The hw_target must be
  specified as an object as returned by the get_hw_targets command. If the
  hardware target is not specified, the current_hw_target will be returned.

Example:

  The following example returns the available hardware targets on the
  connected hardware servers, and sets the current hw_target to the specified
  target:

    get_hw_targets 
       trumpet/xilinx_tcf/Digilent/210203327985A     
       picasso/xilinx_tcf/Digilent/210203368518A 
    current_hw_target [lindex [get_hw_targets] 1]
