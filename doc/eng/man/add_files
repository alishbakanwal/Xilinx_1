Description:

  Adds one or more source files, or the source file contents of one or more
  directories, to the specified fileset in the current project. Valid source
  files include HDL sources (VHDL, Verilog, SystemVerilog, and related header
  files), netlist sources (DCP, EDIF, and NGC), and memory interface files
  (BMM, MIF, MEM, ELF).

  IP and Block Design sources are not added through the add_files command.
  These are compound files that are supported by separate commands such as
  import_ip, read_bd, and read_ip .

  For every file added to a project the Vivado Design Suite attempts to store
  and maintain both a relative path and an absolute path to the file or
  directory. When a project is opened, these paths are used to locate the
  files and directories. By default the Vivado Design Suite applies a
  Relative First approach to resolving paths, searching the relative path
  first, then the absolute path. You can use the PATH_MODE property to change
  how the Vivado tool resolves file paths or properties for specific objects.
  For more information, see the Vivado Design Suite Properties Reference
  Guide (UG912) .

  Note: Adding multiple files one at a time can cause noticeable performance
  degradation. It is more efficient to use a single add_files command to
  import a list of files:

    
    add_files {file1 file2 file3 ... fileN}

  The Vivado tool does not read the contents of a file automatically when the
  file is added to the project with add_files , but rather reads the file
  contents when they are needed. For instance, a constraints file is not read
  when added to the design until needed by synthesis, timing, or
  implementation. To read the file at the time of adding it to the design,
  use the read_xxx command instead.

  Note: When running the Vivado tool in Non-Project mode, in which there is
  no project file to maintain and manage the various project source files,
  you should use the read_xxx commands to read the contents of source files
  into the in-memory design. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide:
  Design Flows Overview (UG892) for more information on Non-Project mode.

  The add_files command adds them by reference to the specified fileset. This
  is different from the import_files command, which copies the file into the
  local project folders as well as adding them to the specified fileset.

  This command returns the files that were added, or returns an error if it
  fails.

Arguments:

  -fileset <name> - (Optional) The fileset to which the specified source
  files should be added. An error is returned if the specified fileset does
  not exist. If no fileset is specified the files are added to the source
  fileset by default.

  -norecurse - (Optional) Do not recurse through subdirectories of any
  specified directories. Without this argument, the tool searches through any
  subdirectories for additional source files that can be added to a project.

  -copy_to <arg> - (Optional) Copy the selected files to the specified
  directory before adding the files to the project. This option lets you move
  files from their current location to a new folder to reference as part of
  the source structure for a project.

  -force - (optional) Overwrite any existing files of the same name as the
  specified files, in the destination directory, when you use the -copy_to
  option.

  -scan_for_includes - (Optional) Scan Verilog source files for any `include
  statements and add these referenced files to the specified fileset. By
  default, `include files are not added to the fileset.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <files> - (Optional) One or more file names or directory names to be added
  to the fileset. If a directory name is specified, all valid source files
  found in the directory, and in subdirectories of the directory, are added
  to the fileset.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the tool will
  search for the specified file in the current working directory and then in
  the directory from which the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example adds a file called rtl.v to the current project:

    add_files rtl.v

  In the preceding example the tool looks for the rtl.v file in the current
  working directory since no file path is specified, and the file is added to
  the source fileset as a default since no fileset is specified.

  The following example adds a file called top.xdc to the constrs_1
  constraint fileset, as well as any appropriate source files found in the
  project_1 directory, and its subdirectories:

    
    add_files -fileset constrs_1 -quiet c:/Design/top.xdc c:/Design/project_1

  In addition, the tool ignores any command line errors because the -quiet
  argument was specified.

  If the -norecurse option had been specified then only constraint files
  found in the project_1 directory would have been added, but subdirectories
  would not be searched.

  The following example adds an existing IP core file to the current project:

    add_files -norecurse C:/Data/ip/c_addsub_v11_0_0.xci

  Note: Use the import_ip command to import the IP file into the local
  project folders.

  The following example reads a top-level design netlist, and the char_fifo
  IP in a Non-Project Mode design:

    # Read top-level EDIF and IP DCP 
    read_edif ./sources/wave_gen.edif 
    add_files ./my_IP/char_fifo/char_fifo.xci

  Note: Either add_files or read_ip can be used reading in an IP core. All
  output products of the IP, including a design checkpoint ( DCP), will be
  read as needed.

  The following example adds an existing DSP module, created in System
  Generator, into the current project:

    add_files C:/Data/model1.mdl

  Note: Use the create_sysgen command to use System Generator to create a new
  DSP module.
