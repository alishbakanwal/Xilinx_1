Description:

  The checkpoint_vcd command inserts current HDL object signal values into
  the Value Change Dump (VCD) file. Nothing is returned. This Tcl command is
  the equivalent of the Verilog $dumpall system task, providing the initial
  values of the specified signals.

  VCD is an ASCII file containing header information, variable definitions,
  and value change details of a set of HDL signals. The VCD file can be used
  to view simulation result in a VCD viewer or to estimate the power
  consumption of the design. See the IEEE Standard for Verilog Hardware
  Description Language (IEEE Std 1364-2005) for a description of the VCD file
  format.

  You must execute the open_vcd and log_vcd commands before using the
  checkpoint_vcd command. After you execute the checkpoint_vcd command, run
  or rerun the simulation to capture the signal values.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following is an example of the checkpoint_vcd command where the command
  dumps signal values of specified HDL objects into the open VCD file:

    checkpoint_vcd
