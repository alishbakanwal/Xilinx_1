Description:

  Upgrade IP Integrator cells to the latest version available in the IP
  Integrator catalog.

  This command lets you update IP Integrator subsystem designs from an
  earlier release to use the IP cores from the latest catalog.

  This command returns the list of IP Integrator cells that were upgraded, or
  returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -latest - (Optional) Upgrade the specified cells to the latest available
  version from the IP catalog. This option is the default, and is not
  required.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - The IP Integrator cells to upgrade to the latest version. These
  objects must be specified using the get_bd_cells command. Objects cannot be
  referenced by name.

Example:

  The following example upgrades the specified cells to the latest version
  available in the IP Integrator catalog:

    upgrade_bd_cells [get_bd_cells {vidOut1 cmpy_1 newMod1}] 
    INFO: [BD 41-1162] The cell `/vidOut1` is already at its latest version.
