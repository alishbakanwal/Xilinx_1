Description:

  Sets the minimum delay allowed on a timing path, specified in nanoseconds
  (ns). The specified delay value is assigned to both the rising and falling
  edges of the defined timing paths unless the -rise or -fall arguments are
  specified.

  Note: The minimum rising and falling delay cannot be greater than the
  maximum rising and falling delay on the same path. If this happens, the
  first assigned delay value is removed from the timing path and reset to 0.

  The delay value must be assigned to a timing path as defined by at least
  one -from, -through, or -to argument. A general path delay such as -to
  endpoint will be over written by a more specific path definition such as
  -from/-to, or -from/-through/-to path definition.

  This command operates silently and does not return direct feedback of its
  operation.

Arguments:

  -rise - (Optional) Apply the delay value to the rising edge of the timing
  path.

  -fall - (Optional) Apply the delay value to the falling edge of the timing
  path.

  -reset_path - (Optional) Clear existing rising or falling edge min delays
  before applying the new specified path delay. If only -to is specified all
  paths leading to the specified endpoints are cleared. If only -from is
  specified, all paths leading from the specified starting points are
  cleared. When -from/-to or -from/-through/-to are specified, the defined
  paths are reset.

  -from <objects> - (Optional) The starting points of the timing paths that
  will be assigned the specified delay. A valid startpoint is a primary input
  or inout port, or the clock pin of a sequential element. If a clock is
  specified then all the primary input and inout ports related to that clock,
  as well as all the clock pins of the registers connected to that clock are
  used as startpoints.

  -rise_from <objects> - (Optional) The starting points of the timing path
  that will have the specified delay assigned to its rising edge.

  -fall_from <objects> - (Optional) The starting points of the timing path
  that will have the specified delay assigned to its falling edge.

  -to <objects> - (Optional) The destination objects for the path that will
  be affected by the minimum delay. A valid endpoint is a primary output or
  inout port, or the data pin of a sequential element. If a clock is
  specified then all the primary output and inout ports related to that
  clock, as well as all the data pins of the registers connected to that
  clock are used as endpoints.

  -rise_to <objects> - (Optional) The destination objects for the rising-edge
  path that will be affected by the minimum delay.

  -fall_to <objects> - (Optional) The destination objects for the
  falling-edge path that will be affected by the minimum delay.

  -through <objects> - (Optional) A list of pins, cell, or nets through which
  the path affected by the minimum delay travels.

  -rise_through <objects> - (Optional) A list of pins, cell, or nets through
  which the rising-edge path affected by the minimum delay travels.

  -fall_through <objects> - (Optional) A list of pins, cell, or nets though
  which the falling-edge path affected by the minimum delay travels.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <delay> - (Required) Specifies the minimum delay value in nanoseconds. The
  <delay> is specified in nanoseconds (ns) as a positive or negative floating
  point number, with a default value of 0.

Examples:

  The following example specifies a minimum delay of 20ns between the primary
  input and output ports (combinational/feedthrough paths):

    set_min_delay 20 -from [all_inputs] -to [all_outputs]

  The following example defines a minimum delay of 20ns for timing paths with
  endpoints at all primary output ports:

    set_min_delay 20 -to [get_ports -filter {DIRECTION == out}]
