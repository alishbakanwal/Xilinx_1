Description:

  Deletes the specified Pblocks from the design. Pblocks are created using
  the create_pblock command.

Arguments:

  -hier - (Optional) Specifies that Pblocks nested inside the specified
  Pblock should also be deleted. If the parent Pblock is deleted without the
  -hier option specified, the nested Pblocks will simply be moved up one
  level.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <pblocks> - (Required) One or more Pblocks to be deleted.

Examples:

  The following example deletes the specified Pblock as well as any Pblocks
  nested inside:

    delete_pblock -hier cpuEngine
