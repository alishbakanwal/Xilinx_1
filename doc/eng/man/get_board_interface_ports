Description:

  Gets a list of various physical ports assigned to the component interfaces
  defined on the current board, as defined in the Board Interface file. The
  interface ports can be returned from component interfaces as specified by
  the get_board_component_interfaces command, or from the component pins
  returned by get_board_component_pins .

  The Board Interface file, board.xml located in the data/boards folder of
  the Vivado Design Suite installation area, stores information regarding
  board attributes. The board provides a representation of the overall system
  that the Xilinx device is a part of, and can help define key aspects of the
  design, such as clock constraints, I/O port assignments, and supported
  interfaces. You can create custom boards by defining a custom Board
  Interface file, as described in the Vivado Design Suite User Guide:
  System-Level Design Entry (UG895).

  In the Board Interface file, a component interface includes a map of the
  logical ports, that are defined in the interface file, with a physical port
  that relates to the component pin or pins on the Xilinx device (part0).

  This command returns a list of the physical ports of the specified
  component interface, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -regexp - (Optional) Specifies that the search <patterns> are written as
  regular expressions. Both search <patterns> and -filter expressions must be
  written as regular expressions when this argument is used. Xilinx regular
  expression Tcl commands are always anchored to the start of the search
  string. You can add ".*" to the beginning or end of a search string to
  widen the search to include a substring. See
  http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html for help with regular expression
  syntax.

  Note: The Tcl built-in command regexp is not anchored, and works as a
  standard Tcl command. For more information refer to
  http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/regexp.htm.

  -nocase - (Optional) Perform case-insensitive matching when a pattern has
  been specified. This argument applies to the use of -regexp only.

  -all - (Optional) Return a list of all component interfaces defined in the
  Board Interface file of the current board.

  -filter - (Optional) Filter the results list with the specified expression.
  The -filter argument filters the list of objects returned by
  get_board_interface_ports based on property values on the interface ports.
  You can find the properties on an object with the report_property or
  list_property commands. Any property/value pair can be used as a filter. In
  the case of the interface port object, "LOGICAL_NAME" and "DIRECTION" are
  two of the properties that can be used to filter results.

  The filter search pattern should be quoted to avoid having to escape
  special characters that may be found in net, pin, or cell names, or other
  properties. String matching is case-sensitive and is always anchored to the
  start and to the end of the search string. The wildcard "*" character can
  be used at the beginning or at the end of a search string to widen the
  search to include a substring of the property value.

  Note: The filter returns an object if a specified property exists on the
  object, and the specified pattern matches the property value on the object.
  In the case of the "*" wildcard character, this will match a property with
  a defined value of "".

  For string comparison, the specific operators that can be used in filter
  expressions are "equal" (==), "not-equal" (!=), "match" (=~), and
  "not-match" (!~). Numeric comparison operators <, >, <=, and >= can also be
  used. Multiple filter expressions can be joined by AND and OR (&& and ||).
  The following gets input pins that do NOT contain the "RESET" substring
  within their name:

    get_pins * -filter {DIRECTION == IN && NAME !~ "*RESET*"}

  Boolean (bool) type properties can be directly evaluated in filter
  expressions as true or not true:

    -filter {IS_PRIMITIVE && !IS_LOC_FIXED}

  -of_objects <args> - (Required) Get the physical interface ports of the
  specified board component interface, or board component pin objects.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <patterns> - (Optional) Match physical interface ports against the
  specified search patterns. The default pattern is the wildcard `*` which
  gets a list of all component interface ports defined on the specified
  object.

Examples:

  The following example gets the board interface ports defined in the Board
  Interface file for the specified board component:

    get_board_interface_ports -of_objects \ 
       [get_board_component_interfaces *gmii*]
