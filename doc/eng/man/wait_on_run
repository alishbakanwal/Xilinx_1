Description:

  Blocks the execution of Tcl commands until the specified run has completed
  either successfully or in error, or until the specified amount of time has
  elapsed.

  This command will tell you when the run has terminated, but not the results
  of the run. To determine if the run has completed successfully, you could
  query the value of the PROGRESS property of the run:

    launch_runs synth_1  
    wait_on_run synth_1  
    if {[get_property PROGRESS [get_runs synth_1]] != "100%"} {  
       error "ERROR: synth_1 failed"  
    }

  The wait_on_run command can be used for runs that have been launched. If
  the specified run has not been launched when the wait_on_run command is
  used, you will get an error. Runs that have already completed do not return
  an error.

  Note: This command is used for running the tool in batch mode or from Tcl
  scripts. It is ignored when running interactively from the GUI.

Arguments:

  -timeout <arg> - (Optional) The time in minutes that the wait_on_run
  command should wait until the run finishes. This allows you to define a
  period of time beyond which the tool should resume executing Tcl commands
  even if the specified run has not finished execution. The default value of
  -1 is used if timeout is not specified, meaning that there is no limit to
  the amount of time the tool will wait for the run to complete.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <run> - (Required) The name of the run to wait on.

Examples:

  The following example launches the impl_1 run, and then waits for the
  specified run to complete, or to wait for one hour, whichever occurs first:

    launch_runs impl_1 
    wait_on_run -timeout 60 impl_1
