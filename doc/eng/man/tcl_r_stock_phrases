Arguments:

  <p id="arg_quiet"> -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly,
  returning no messages from the command. The command also returns TCL_OK
  regardless of any errors encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  <p id="arg_verbose">-verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message
  limits and return all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <p id="arg_regex">-regexp - (Optional) Specifies that the search <patterns>
  are written as regular expressions. Both search <patterns> and -filter
  expressions must be written as regular expressions when this argument is
  used. Xilinx regular expression Tcl commands are always anchored to the
  start of the search string. You can add ".*" to the beginning or end of a
  search string to widen the search to include a substring. See
  http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html for help with regular expression
  syntax.

  Note: The Tcl built-in command regexp is not anchored, and works as a
  standard Tcl command. For more information refer to
  http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/regexp.htm.

  <p id="arg_nocase">-nocase - (Optional) Perform case-insensitive matching
  when a pattern has been specified. This argument applies to the use of
  -regexp only.

  <p id="arg_operators">The filter search pattern should be quoted to avoid
  having to escape special characters that may be found in net, pin, or cell
  names, or other properties. String matching is case-sensitive and is always
  anchored to the start and to the end of the search string. The wildcard "*"
  character can be used at the beginning or at the end of a search string to
  widen the search to include a substring of the property value.

  Note: The filter returns an object if a specified property exists on the
  object, and the specified pattern matches the property value on the object.
  In the case of the "*" wildcard character, this will match a property with
  a defined value of "".

  <p id="arg_operators_1">For string comparison, the specific operators that
  can be used in filter expressions are "equal" (==), "not-equal" (!=),
  "match" (=~), and "not-match" (!~). Numeric comparison operators <, >, <=,
  and >= can also be used. Multiple filter expressions can be joined by AND
  and OR (&& and ||). The following gets input pins that do NOT contain the
  "RESET" substring within their name:

    get_pins * -filter {DIRECTION == IN && NAME !~ "*RESET*"}

  <p id="arg_operators_2">Boolean (bool ) type properties can be directly
  evaluated in filter expressions as true or not true:

    -filter {IS_PRIMITIVE && !IS_LOC_FIXED}

  <p id="arg_editNetlist">Netlist editing changes the in-memory view of the
  netlist in the current design. It does not change the files in the source
  fileset, or change the persistent design on the disk. Changes made to the
  netlist may be saved to a design checkpoint using the write_checkpoint
  command, or may be exported to a netlist file such as Verilog, VHDL, or
  EDIF, using the appropriate write_* command.

  Note: Netlist editing is not allowed on the elaborated RTL design.

Notes:

  Note: To improve memory and performance, the get_* commands return a
  container list of a single type of objects (e.g. cells, nets, pins, or
  ports). You can add new objects to the list (using lappend for instance),
  but you can only add the same type of object that is currently in the list.
  Adding a different type of object, or string, to the list is not permitted
  and will result in a Tcl error.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the tool will
  search for the specified file in the current working directory and then in
  the directory from which the tool was launched.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  Note: The -of_objects option requires objects to be specified using the
  get_* commands, such as get_cells or get_pins , rather than specifying
  objects by name. In addition, -of_objects cannot be used with a search
  <pattern> .

  Note: This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it
  fails.

  Note: You must use the open_hw command to open the Hardware Manager in the
  Vivado Design Suite before using this command.
