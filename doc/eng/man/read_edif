Description:

  Imports an EDIF or NGC netlist file into the Design Source fileset of the
  current project.

  Note: NGC format files are not supported in the Vivado Design Suite for
  UltraScale devices. It is recommended that you regenerate the IP using the
  Vivado Design Suite IP customization tools with native output products.
  Alternatively, you can use the NGC2EDIF command to migrate the NGC file to
  EDIF format for importing. For more information refer to the ISE to Vivado
  Design Suite Migration Guide (UG911).

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <files> - (Required) The name of the EDIF or NGC files to be imported.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the tool will
  search for the specified file in the current working directory and then in
  the directory from which the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example imports an EDIF file into the open project:

    read_edif C/Data/bft_top.edf
