Description:

  Output the currently opened, or specified Schematic window in the Vivado
  IDE to a file.

  The file can be written as a native ASCII file that can be read back into
  the Vivado IDE using the read_schematic command, or can be written as a PDF
  or SVG file for use outside of the Vivado Design Suite. This can be useful
  when documenting IP cores from the IP Packager flow, or from the Vivado IP
  Integrator.

Arguments:

  -force - (Optional) Overwrite the specified Schematic file if it already
  exists.

  -format [ native | pdf | svg ] - (Optional) Write the output file in the
  specified format. The default file format is native to the Vivado Design
  Suite, that can be read back into the tool using the read_schematic
  command. SVG is scalable vector graphics format. PDF is portable document
  format.

  Note: The -format argument is case sensitive.

  -orientation [ landscape | portrait ] - (Optional) Write the schematic in a
  vertical (portrait) or horizontal (landscape) orientation. The default is
  portrait.

  -scope [ current_page | visible | all ] - (Optional) Write the current page
  of the schematic, or the visible content displayed in the schematic window,
  or all of the schematic. The default is current_page.

  -name <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the name of the open Schematic window to
  write. Use this option to write the specified schematic window when more
  than one schematic window is opened.

  Note: When multiple schematic windows are opened, the first opened window
  is written if -name is not specified.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - (Required) The path and filename of the Schematic file to write.
  The path is optional, but if one is not provided the Schematic file will be
  written to the current working directory, or the directory from which the
  Vivado tool was launched.

Example:

  The following example writes the specified Schematic window, displayed in
  the Vivado IDE, to a native format file that can later be read back into
  the Vivado Design Suite, overwriting the specified file if it already
  exists:

    write_schematic -name Schematic C:/Data/mySchematic.txt -force

  The following example writes a PDF file with a horizontal view of the
  specified schematic window:

    write_schematic -format pdf -name "Schematic (2)" C:/Data/mySchematic.pdf \ 
    -orientation landscape
