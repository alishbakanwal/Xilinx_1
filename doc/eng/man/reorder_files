Description:

  Reorders source files in the specified fileset. Takes the files indicated
  and places them at the front of, the back of, or before or after other
  files within the fileset. This command also has an auto reorder feature
  that reorders the files based on the requirements of the current top module
  in the design.

Arguments:

  -fileset <arg> - (Optional) The fileset in which to reorder files. The
  default is the sources_1 source fileset.

  -before <arg> - (Optional) Place the specified files before this file in
  the fileset. The file must be specified with the full path name in the
  fileset.

  -after <arg> - (Optional) Place the specified files after this file in the
  fileset. The file must be specified with the full path name in the fileset.

  -front - (Optional) Place the specified files at the front of the list of
  files in the fileset.

  -back - (Optional) Place the specified files at the back of the list of
  files in the fileset.

  -auto - (Optional) Enable automatic reordering based on the hierarchy
  requirements of the current top-module in the project. Often used after
  changing the top module with the "set_property top" command.

  -disable_unused - (Optional) Disable any files not currently used by the
  hierarchy based on the top-module. Often used after changing the top module
  with the "set_property top" command.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <files> - (Required) One or more files to relocate in the fileset. Files
  must be specified by their full path name in the fileset, and are reordered
  in the order they are specified.

Examples:

  The following example takes the specified files and moves them to the front
  of the source fileset:

    reorder_files -front {C:/Data/FPGA/file1.vhdl C:/Data/FPGA/file2.vhdl}

  Note: The default source fileset is used in the preceding example since the
  -fileset argument is not specified.

  The following example sets a new top_module in the design, and then
  automatically reorders and disables unused files based on the hierarchy of
  the new top-module:

    set_property top block1 [current_fileset] 
    reorder_files -auto -disable_unused
