Description:

  Sets the real-world operating conditions that are used when performing
  analysis of the design. The environmental operating conditions of the
  device are used for power analysis when running the report_power command,
  and can also affect timing analysis.

  Note: This command operates silently and does not return direct feedback of
  its operation.

  Operating conditions can be restored to their default values with the use
  of the reset_operating_conditions command.

  Current operating conditions can be reported with the
  report_operating_conditions command.

Arguments:

  -voltage <arg> - (Optional) List of voltage supply names and their values
  specified in pairs. Supported voltage supply names and their values vary by
  family. For example if a family supports a voltage supply named Vccint, you
  can set the supply voltage to 0.8 with the following argument and value :
  -voltage {Vccint 0.8}

  Note: For UltraScale devices, when changing the Vccint voltage, the Vivado
  tool will automatically change the device to or from a low-voltage device
  as indicated by the voltage level specified. This will also affect timing
  analysis.

  -grade <arg> - (Optional) The temperature grade of the target device.
  Supported values vary by family. The default value is "commercial".

  -process <arg> - (Optional) The manufacturing process characteristics to
  assume. Valid values are "typical" or "maximum". The default value is
  "typical".

  -junction_temp <arg> - (Optional) The device junction temperature used for
  modeling. Valid values are "auto" or an actual temperature specified in
  degrees C. The default value is "auto".

  -ambient_temp <arg> - (Optional) The environment ambient temperature in
  degrees C. The default setting is "default".

  -thetaja <arg> - (Optional) The Theta-JA thermal resistance used for
  modeling in degrees C/W. The default setting is "auto".

  -thetasa <arg> - (Optional) The Theta-SA thermal resistance used during
  modeling in degrees C/W. The default setting is "auto".

  -airflow <[0:750]> - (Optional) Linear Feet Per Minute (LFM) airflow to be
  used for modeling. The default setting varies by device family.

  -heatsink <arg> - (Optional) The heatsink profile to be used during
  modeling. Valid values are: none, low, medium, high, custom. The default
  setting is "medium".

  -thetajb <arg> - (Optional) The Theta-JB thermal resistance used for
  modeling in degrees C/W. The default setting is "auto".

  -board <arg> - (Optional) The board size to be used for modeling. The valid
  values are: jedec, small, medium, large, custom. The default value is
  "medium".

  -board_temp <arg> - (Optional) The board temperature in degrees Centigrade
  to be used for modeling.

  -board_layers <arg> - (Optional) The number of board layers to be used for
  modeling. Valid values are: "4to7" for boards with 4 to 7 layers, "8to11"
  for boards with 8 to 11 layers, "12to15" for boards with 12 to 15 layers,
  and "16+" for boards with 16 or more layers. The default setting is
  "12to15".

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example specifies an industrial grade device with an ambient
  operating temperature of 75 degrees C:

    set_operating_conditions -grade industrial -ambient_temp 75

  The following example sets the supply voltage Vccaux to a value of 1.9 :

    set_operating_conditions  -voltage {Vccaux 1.89}

  The following example sets the manufacturing process corner to maximum:

    set_operating_conditions -process maximum

  The following example sets the manufacturing process corner to maximum and
  the voltage supply Vccint to 0.875:

    set_operating_conditions -process maximum -voltage {Vccint 0.875}
