Description:

  Stop writing the simulation values to the current Value Change Dump (VCD)
  file. This suspends the output of simulation information to the file until
  the process is resumed using the start_vcdcommand.

  This Tcl command models the behavior of the Verilog $dumpoff system task.

  Note: You must execute the open_vcd command before using the stop_vcd
  command.

  Nothing is returned by the command.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example stops writing simulation values to the current VCD
  file:

    stop_vcd
