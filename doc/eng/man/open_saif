Description:

  Create or open a Switching Activity Interchange Format (SAIF) file for
  storing signal switching rates in the current simulation for later use by
  the report_power command.

  The Switching Activity Interchange format (SAIF) file is an ASCII file
  containing header information, and toggle counts for the specified signals
  of the design. It also contains the timing attributes which specify time
  durations for signals at level 0, 1, X, or Z.

  The SAIF file is recommended for power analysis since it is smaller than
  the VCD file.

  When an SAIF file has been opened, you can write the switching activity
  from the simulation into the SAIF file using log_saif.

  Only one SAIF can be open at one time during simulation. To close the SAIF
  file, use the close_saif command.

  This command returns the object ID of the opened SAIF file, or returns an
  error if the command failed.

Arguments:

  -quiet - Execute the command quietly, ignore any command line errors, and
  return no error messages if the command fails to execute.

  -verbose - Suspends message limits during command execution.

  <file_name> - Specifies the name of the SAIF file to open.

Examples:

  The following example opens the specified simulation:

    open_saif myData.saif
