  Deletes the specified fileset. However, if the fileset cannot be deleted,
  then no message is returned.

Arguments:

  -merge <arg> - (Optional) Specify a different fileset to merge the files
  from the deleted fileset into. If the -merge option is not specified, then
  all files in the fileset are removed from the project.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <fileset> - (Required) The name of the fileset to delete. The last
  constraint or simulation fileset will not be deleted, and no error will be
  returned under these circumstances.

Examples:

  The following example deletes the sim_2 fileset from the current project.

    delete_fileset sim_2

  Note: The fileset and all of its files are removed from the project. The
  files are not removed from the hard drive.
