Description:

  Archives a project to store as backup, or to encapsulate the design and
  send it to a remote site. The tool parses the hierarchy of the design,
  copies the required source files, include files, and remote files from the
  library directories, copies the constraint files, copies the results of the
  various synthesis, simulation, and implementation runs, and then creates a
  ZIP file of the project.

  Note: An alternative method of archiving the project is using
  write_project_tcl to create a Tcl script that will recreate the project in
  its current form.

Arguments:

  -temp_dir <arg> - (Optional) Specify a temporary directory to copy files to
  when creating the project archive. The temporary directory will be created
  if it does not exist, and will be emptied when the archive process is
  complete. By default, the Vivado tool will create a temporary directory
  inside of the current working directory.

  -force - (Optional) Overwrite an existing ZIP file of the same name. If the
  ZIP file exists, the tool returns an error unless the -force argument is
  specified.

  -exclude_run_results - (Optional) Exclude the results of any synthesis or
  implementation runs. This command can greatly reduce the size of a project
  archive.

  -include_config_settings - (Optional) Add any initialization Tcl commands
  (init.tcl) to the archive file under the <project_name> /config_settings
  folder.

  -include_runs_in_progress - (Optional ) Include data in the archive from
  the directories of incomplete runs. This switch will be ignored if
  -exclude_run_results is specified.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - (Optional) The name of the ZIP file to be created by the
  archive_project command. If <file> is not specified, a ZIP file with the
  same name as the project is created.

Examples:

  The following command archives the current project:

    archive_project

  Note: The project archive is named <project_name> .zip because no file name
  is specified.

  The following example specifies project_3 as the current project, and then
  archives that project into a file called proj3.zip:

    current_project project_3 
    archive_project -force -exclude_run_results proj3.zip

  Note: The use of the -force argument causes the tool to overwrite the
  proj3.zip file if one exists. The use of the -exclude_run_results argument
  causes the tool to leave any results from synthesis or implementation runs
  out of the archive. The various runs defined in the project are included in
  the archive, but not any of the results.

  The following command archives the current project in the specified file,
  overwrites an existing file if needed, excludes the run results, and
  includes any configuration settings used when launching the Vivado tool:

    archive_project -force mb1_archive.zip -temp_dir C:/Data/Temp \ 
       -exclude_run_results -include_config_settings
