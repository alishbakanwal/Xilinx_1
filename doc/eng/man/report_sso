Description:

  Performs a weighted average simultaneous switching outputs (WASSO) analysis
  of the current synthesized or implemented design to validate signal
  integrity based on the I/O pin and bank assignments in the design.

  The report_sso command is for Spartan-3, Virtex-4, and Virtex-5 devices,
  and provides an approximation of switching noises for these devices. For
  Spartan-6, Virtex-6, Virtex-7, Kintex-7, and Artix-7 devices the tool
  supports a more detailed SSN analysis using the report_ssn command.

  The WASSO analysis is performed with the FPGA device in the context of the
  system-level design. The details of the printed circuit board that the FPGA
  device will be mounted to is considered as part of the operating
  environment during analysis. The attributes of the PCB can be defined with
  the various arguments of the report_sso command, or left with the default
  values.

Arguments:

  -name <arg> - Specifies the name of the result set to output.

  -return_string - Directs the output to a Tcl string. The Tcl string can be
  captured by a variable definition and parsed or otherwise processed.

  Note: This argument cannot be used with the -file option.

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the SSO report into the specified file. The
  specified file will be overwritten if one already exists, unless -append is
  also specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - Append the output of the command to the specified file rather
  than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  Specify the following parameters to define the Printed Circuit Board (PCB)
  that the FPGA is mounted to:

   *  -board_thickness <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the thickness in mils of
      the PCB that the FPGA device is mounted onto. The default value is 62
      mils.

   *  -via_diameter <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the diameter in mils of
      breakout vias in the PCB. The default value is 12 mils.

   *  -pad_to_via_breakout_length <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the length in
      mils of the breakout wire (or trace) from the pad on the FPGA package
      or socket to the breakout via on the PCB. The default value is 33 mils.

   *  -breakout_width <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the width in mils of the
      breakout wire on the PCB. The default value is 12 mils.

   *  -socket_inductance <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the inductance in
      nanohenries (nH) of the mounting socket between the FPGA and the PCB if
      one is used. The default value is 0 nH.

   *  -other_pcb_inductance <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the inductance of
      the PCB in nanohenries (nH). The default is 0 nH.

  Specify the following FPGA device parameters to describe the target device:

   *  -ground_bounce <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the allowed undershoot or
      overshoot voltage of the signal on the PCB in milliVolts (mV). The
      lowest permitted value should be used to provide a conservative WASSO
      analysis. The default value is 600 mW.

   *  -output_cap <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the capacitance in picoFarads
      (pF) on the output pins of the FPGA device. The default value is 15 pF.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example performs an SSO analysis on the current synthesis or
  implemented design, using the default settings for board and device, and
  writes the output to the specified file:

    report_sso -file C:/Data/devSSO.txt

  The following example performs an SSO analysis on the current synthesis or
  implemented design, using the specified values to define the system-level
  PCB:

    report_sso -name sso_1 -file C:/Data/mySSO1.txt \ 
       -board_thickness 55 -via_diameter 9 -pad_to_via_breakout_length 75 \ 
       -breakout_width 9 -other_pcb_inductance 37 -socket_inductance 19 \ 
       -ground_bounce 537 -output_cap 12
