Description:

  Suspend a Tcl script or Tcl command processing until the specified serial
  I/O analyzer scan is complete.

  This command is used after the run_hw_sio_scan command to pause Tcl
  processing to wait for the scan to complete. When the wait_on_sio_scan
  command returns, the Tcl command or script processing can continue.

  This command operates silently, returning nothing if successful, or
  returning an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -timeout <arg> - (Optional) Wait for this period of time for the serial I/O
  analyzer scan to complete. If the timeout interval is reached, the wait
  command is terminated.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_sio_scans> - (Required) Specify one or more hw_sio_scan objects to wait
  on. The hw_sio_scan must be specified as an object as returned by the
  create_hw_sio_scan or get_hw_sio_scans commands.

Example:

  The following example waits for the serial I/O analyzer scan to complete:

    run_hw_sio_scan [lindex [get_hw_sio_scans {SCAN_0}] 0] 
    wait_on_hw_sio_scan [lindex [get_hw_sio_scans {SCAN_0}] 0]
