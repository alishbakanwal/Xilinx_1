Description:

  Disables timing arcs within a specified cell or cells that lead to the
  output pins of the cell. Only the I/O paths between the clock port and the
  outputs of the cell are disabled.

  The purpose of disabling a timing arc is to prevent timing analysis through
  the arc.

  If a <cell> is specified, then all timing arcs in that cell are disabled.
  If the optional -from and -to arguments are specified, then the timing arcs
  are defined by the from/to pins. If only -from is speified then all timing
  arcs from that pin are disabled. If only -to is specified then all timing
  paths to that pin are disabled.

  If a <port> is specified, then all timing paths from a specified input port
  are disabled, or timing paths to a specified output port are disabled.

  Note: This command operates silently and does not return direct feedback of
  its operation

Arguments:

  -from <pin_name> - (Optional) Specifies the source pin of an object cell.
  The pin_name is specified by name only, without the need for the
  hierarchical cell name, which is defined by the <object>.

  -to <pin_name> - (Optional) Specifies the destination pin of an object
  cell. The pin_name is specified by name only, without the need for the
  hierarchical cell name, which is defined by the <object>.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - (Required) A list of one or more objects on which to disable
  the timing arcs. Must be specified as Vivado objects returned by get_cells
  or other appropriate Tcl commands. Can be any of the following types of
  objects: cells, ports, pins, lib-cells, lib-pins, lib-cell/cell timing
  arcs.

Examples:

  The following example disable the timing check between AX to AMUX pin of
  cell abc:

    
    set_disable_timing -from C -to R [get_cells OpMode_pad_0_o_reg[0]]

  The following example disables the timing arcs between the specified input
  pin to the specified output pin of a BRAM cell:

    
    set_disable_timing -from WEBWE[3] -to CLKMEM [get_cells \ 
       ldpc_dout360_channel/U_AP_FIFO_ldpc_dout360_channel_ram/mem_reg_0]

  The following example disables all timing arcs of the specified cell:

    set arcs [get_timing_arcs -of_objects [get_cells \ 
       ldpc_dout360_channel/U_AP_FIFO_ldpc_dout360_channel_ram/mem_reg_0]] 
    set_disable_timing $arcs
