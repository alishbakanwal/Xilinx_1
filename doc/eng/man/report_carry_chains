Description:

  Report the details of the carry chains used by the current open design. The
  report includes the average depth of all carry chains, as well as the
  specific depth of each carry chain reported.

  By default, the longest carry chain is reported, but the number of chains
  reported can be specified.

  The command returns the carry chain report.

Arguments:

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file. The
  specified file will be overwritten if one already exists.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string rather than
  to the standard output. The Tcl string can be captured by a variable
  definition and parsed or otherwise processed.

  Note: This argument cannot be used with the -file option.

  -max_chains <arg> - (Optional) Number of chains to report. By default the
  longest carry chain is reported.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example returns the 10 longest carry chains in the design:

    report_carry_chains -max_chains 10
