Description:

  This command exports a Xilinx Native Circuit Description (NCD) file from an
  implemented design. The NCD file is created by MAP and PAR during
  implementation, and converts the logical Netlist Design into a physical
  design implementing the targeted Xilinx device architecture.

Arguments:

  -force - Overwrite the NCD file if it already exists.

  <file> - The filename of the NCD file to write.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example writes an NCD file from the current implemented
  design to the specified file:

    write_ncd C:/Data/FPGA_Design/designOut.ncd
