  Stop the specified scan running in the Vivado serial I/O analyzer.

  To analyze the margin of a given link, it is often helpful to run a scan of
  the link using the specialized Eye Scan hardware of Xilinx UltraScale
  devices or 7 Series FPGAs. The Vivado serial I/O analyzer feature lets you
  to create, run, and save link scans.

  This command lets you stop a scan that is in progress as started with the
  run_hw_sio_scan command.

  You can remove the created scan object using remove_hw_sio_scan.

  This command returns a message if successful, or returns an error if the
  command fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_sio_scans> - (Required) Specify one or more hw_sio_scan objects to
  stop. The hw_sio_scan must be specified as an object as returned by the
  get_hw_sio_scans commands.

Example:

  The following example launches a scan using the run_hw_sio_scan command,
  and then stops the specified scan:

    run_hw_sio_scan [lindex [get_hw_sio_scans {SCAN_3}] 0] 
    stop_hw_sio_scan [get_hw_sio_scans SCAN_3]
