Description:

  Open an example project for the specified IP cores. The example project can
  be used to explore the features of the IP core in a stand-alone project,
  instead of integrated into the current project.

Arguments:

  -dir <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the path to the directory where the
  example project will be written.

  -force - (Optional) Force the opening of a new example project, overwriting
  an existing example project at the specified path.

  -in_process - (Optional) Open the example project in the same tool process
  as the current project. As a default, without this argument, a new process
  instance of the tool will be launched for the example project.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - (Required) The IP cores to open example projects for.

Examples:

  The following copies the IP customization and opens the example project for
  the specified IP core in a new location:

    open_example_project -dir C:/Data/examples -force [get_ips blk_mem*]
