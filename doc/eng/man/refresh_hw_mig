Description:

  Refreshes the in-memory view of all of the properties, or specified
  properties, of the specified hw_mig objects with values read from the
  current hardware device.

  The refresh command takes the values from the memory controller implemented
  on the hardware device, and populates them into the appropriate properties
  of the hw_mig debug core in the Vivado logic analyzer, or standalone Vivado
  Lab Edition.

  At least one object is required. If properties are specified that do not
  exist in the object, that property will not be refreshed.

  This command updates the properties on the hw_mig object, but otherwise
  returns nothing if successful. The command returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -regexp - (Optional) The list of properties to refresh is defined using
  regular expression.

  -properties <args> - (Optional) Refresh the specified property or
  properties of the hw_mig object. As a default behavior, if no properties
  are specified, all properties of the specified object or objects will be
  refreshed from the current values on the hardware device.

  Note: If a non-existent property is specified, that property is ignored.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_objects> - (Optional) Inputs can be any hw_mig, hw_device, hw_target,
  or hw_server object.

  Note: The objects must be specified using the appropriate get_hw_xxx
  command, for instance get_hw_migs, rather than specified by name.

Example:

  The following example refreshes all of the properties of the memory IP in
  the Vivado logic analyzer with the properties from the current hw_device:

    refresh_hw_mig [lindex [get_hw_migs] 0]
