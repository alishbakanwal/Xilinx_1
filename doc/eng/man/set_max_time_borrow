Description:

  Sets the maximum amount of time in nanoseconds that can be borrowed between
  nets when analyzing the timing on latches.

  Note: This command operates silently and does not return direct feedback of
  its operation.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <delay> - (Required) The delay that should be applied to the specified
  objects. The <delay> is specified in nanoseconds (ns) as a floating point
  number >= 0, with a default value of 0.

  <objects> - (Required) A list of clocks, cells, data pins, or clock pins to
  which the limit should be applied.

Examples:

  The following example specifies that the latches attached to "all clocks"
  will be allowed 0 time units of borrowing. Effectively, this disables time
  borrowing throughout the entire design.

    set_max_time_borrow 0.0 [all_clocks]

  The following example specifies that nets in the top level of hierarchy are
  allowed 20 time units of time borrowing:

    set_max_time_borrow 20 {top/*}
