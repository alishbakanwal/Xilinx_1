Description:

  This command deletes the hw_bitstream object from the specified hw_device
  objects.

  This clears the PROGRAM.HW_BITSTREAM and PROGRAM.FILE properties on the
  hw_device objects, and deletes the hw_bitstream object.

Arguments:

  -of_objects <arg> - (Optional) Delete the hardware bitstream object
  (hw_bitstream) associated with the specified hardware devices (hw_devices).
  The targets must be specified as objects using the get_hw_devices or the
  current_hw_device commands.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Example:

  The following example deletes the hw_bitstream object associated with the
  current hardware device:

    delete_hw_bitstream -of_objects [current_hw_device]
