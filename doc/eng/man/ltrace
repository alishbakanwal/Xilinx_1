Description:

  Enables line-level tracing for simulation debugging purposes.

  During simulation the simulation source file and line number being
  evaluated is returned to the Tcl console.

  Note: Process tracing with the ptrace command provides more detailed
  information than is available with line tracing.

  This feature can also be enabled using the LINE_TRACING property on the
  current simulation object:

    set_property LINE_TRACING on [current_sim]

  The command returns the state of line tracing, or returns an error if it
  fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <value> - (Required) Enables or disables line tracing during simulation.
  Specify a <value> of true to enable process tracing, or false to disable
  it.

Example:

  The following example enables line tracing:

    ltrace true
