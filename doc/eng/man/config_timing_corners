Description:

  This command configures the Slow and Fast timing corners in the current
  design for single or multi-corner timing analysis. A synthesized or
  implemented design must be opened when running this command.

  The variation in the manufacturing process of the physical device, and the
  voltage and temperature at which the device is operating, combine to create
  a timing corner. These three variables (PVT) determine the delay across the
  device. The fast corner represents a device operating with the smallest
  manufacturing process tolerances, the highest voltage, and the lowest
  temperature. The slow corner represents a device operating with the
  greatest manufacturing tolerances, the lowest voltage, and the highest
  temperature. By default the Vivado Design Suite performs both a setup and
  hold analysis for both slow and fast process corners, also known as quad
  analysis:

    config_timing_corners -corner Slow -setup -hold 
    config_timing_corners -corner Fast -setup -hold

  The config_timing_corners command can be used to limit the default four
  corner analysis performed by the Vivado timing engine as appropriate to the
  design, to improve timing performance. To change or disable the default
  analysis for both corners, you must configure both the Fast and Slow
  corners:

    config_timing_corners -corner Slow -delay_type max 
    config_timing_corners -corner Fast -delay_type none

  Note: This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it
  fails.

Arguments:

  -corner [ Slow | Fast ] - (Optional) Specifies the timing corner to be
  configured. Valid values are "Slow" and "Fast". If -corner is not
  specified, the -delay_type applies to both corners.

  Note: The names of the corners are case sensitive.

  -delay_type <value> - (Optional) Specify the type of path delays to be
  analyzed for the specified timing corner. Valid values are "none", "max",
  "min" and "min_max". A -delay_type of "none" excludes the specified -corner
  from timing analysis.

  Note: Although -delay_type and -setup/-hold are both optional, one of these
  options are required to configure the specified corner.

  -setup - (Optional) Specifies setup analysis for the specified timing
  corner. This is the same as -delay_type max.

  -hold - (Optional) Specifies hold analysis for the timing corner. This is
  the same as -delay_type min.

  Note: You can specify both -setup and -hold which is the same as
  -delay_type min_max.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example configures the Slow timing corner for both setup and
  hold analysis:

    config_timing_corners -corner Slow -setup -hold 
    config_timing_corners -corner Slow -delay_type min_max

  Note: The two preceding examples have the same effect.

  The following example configures the Fast corner for min delay analysis,
  and disables the Slow corner analysis:

    config_timing_corners -corner Fast -delay_type min 
    config_timing_corners -corner Slow -delay_type none
