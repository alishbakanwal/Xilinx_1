Description:

  Gets the objects currently selected in the Vivado IDE by the select_objects
  command. Can get the primary selected object and any secondary selected
  objects as well.

  Note: This Tcl command works only when Vivado is run in GUI mode.

  Primary objects are directly selected, while secondary objects are selected
  based on the selection rules currently defined by the Tools > Options
  command. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Using the IDE (UG893)
  for more information on setting selection rules.

  This command returns a Tcl list of selected objects, even a list with just
  one object. This can be an issue for some of the Vivado tool commands that
  do not accept a list of objects, such as the current_instance command. In
  this case you can use lindex to pass a specific object from the
  get_selected_objects list to the current_instance command:

    current_instance [lindex [get_selected_objects] 0]

Arguments:

  -primary - (Optional) Indicates that only the primary selected object or
  objects should be returned; not secondary objects. As a default
  get_selected_objects will return all currently selected objects.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example reports the properties of all currently selected
  objects, both primary and secondary:

    report_property [get_selected_objects]
