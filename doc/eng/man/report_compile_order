Description:

  Report the compilation order of files in the various active filesets:
  constraints, design sources, and simulation sources.

  This command returns the order of file processing for synthesis,
  implementation, and simulation. The report can be limited by specifying the
  fileset of interest with -fileset, or using the -constraints option or
  -sources option.

  The -used_in option lets you report the processing order of files used in
  Synthesis, Simulation, or one of the implementation steps, according to the
  value of the USED_IN property.

  By default the report is returned to the Tcl console, or standard output,
  but it can also be written to a file.

Arguments:

  -of_objects <args> - (Optional) Report the files that are associated with
  the specified filesets, sub-designs, or reconfiguration modules. The
  default is to search all filesets. When -compile_order and -used_in are
  specified, the -of_objects switch will only accept a single fileset, or a
  single sub-design such as an IP core, Block Design, or DSP design. A
  sub-design is also known as a composite file.

  Note: The -of_objects option requires objects to be specified using the
  get_* commands, such as get_cells or get_pins, rather than specifying
  objects by name. In addition, -of_objects cannot be used with a search
  <pattern>.

  -fileset <arg> - (Optional) Limit the report to the specified fileset.

  -missing_instances - (Optional) Return the list of cells that are missing
  source files in the current or specified fileset.

  -constraints - (Optional) Report the compilation order of the constraint
  files in the current design, including constraints for any IP in the
  design.

  -sources - (Optional) Report the compilation order of files found in the
  sources_1 fileset of design sources.

  -used_in <arg> - (Optional) Accepts one of the enumerated values of the
  USED_IN property for files, and returns files matching the specified value.
  Valid values for this option include the following: synthesis, simulation,
  or implementation. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite Properties Reference
  Guide (UG912) for information on the USED_IN property and its supported
  values.

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file. The
  specified file will be overwritten if one already exists, unless -append is
  also specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example reports the compilation order of the active filesets
  in the current design:

    report_compile_order

  The following returns a list of cells with missing source files in the
  current design, and appends the report to the specified file:

    report_compile_order -missing_instances -file C:/Data/report1.txt -append

  The following command lists the compile order of the files in the active
  constraint set:

    report_compile_order -constraints
