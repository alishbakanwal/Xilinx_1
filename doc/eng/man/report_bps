Description:

  Report a specific breakpoint object, or report all breakpoints in the
  current simulation. You must have an open simulation for this command to
  return anything.

  A breakpoint is a user-determined stopping point in the source code used
  for debugging the design. When simulating a design with breakpoints,
  simulation of the design stops at each breakpoint to let you examine values
  and verify the design behavior.

  This command returns the filename and line number of the specified
  breakpoints, or of all breakpoints in the current simulation, or returns an
  error if the command fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <BreakPointObjs> - Specifies one or more breakpoint objects in the current
  simulation to report. The breakpoint object is returned by the add_bp
  command when the breakpoint is added to the simulation.

Examples:

  The following example reports all breakpoints in the current simulation:

    report_bps

  This example reports the specified breakpoints in the current simulation:

    report_bps bp1 bp2 bp5
