Description:

  The add_bp command lets you add breakpoints to an HDL source file to pause
  the current simulation.

  A breakpoint is a user-determined stopping point in the source code used
  for debugging the design. When simulating a design with breakpoints,
  simulation of the design stops at each breakpoint to let you examine values
  and verify the design behavior.

  You can report breakpoints in the current simulation using the report_bps
  command, and remove existing breakpoints using the remove_bps command.

  This command returns a new breakpoint object if there is not already a
  breakpoint set at the specified file line, or returns an existing
  breakpoint object if there is already a breakpoint defined for the
  specified file and line number.

  Note: You can capture the returned breakpoint object in a Tcl variable if
  needed.

  The add_bp command returns an error if the command fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file_name> - (Required) The name of the HDL source file to add a
  breakpoint to.

  <line_number> - (Required) The line number of the specified <file_name> to
  add the breakpoint to.

Examples:

  The following example adds a the breakpoint to the HDL source file at the
  specified line number:

    add_bp C:/Data/ug937/sources/sinegen.vhd 137
