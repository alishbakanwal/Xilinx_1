Description:

  Check the current design against a specified set of methodology checks and
  report any errors or violations that are found.

  Methodology checks are a special class of design rule checks (DRC) that are
  accessible through this separate Tcl command. The methodology checks are a
  necessary part of the design flow, and should be considered mandatory after
  implementation and prior to generating the bitstream.

  Note: Other than their availability through the separate report_methodology
  command, the checks are standard design rule checks in every other way.

  The report_methodology command requires an open design to check the design
  rules against. The command returns a report with the results of violations
  found by the design rule checks. Violations are returned as Vivado objects
  that can be listed with the get_drc_violations command, and are associated
  with cells, pins, ports, nets, and sites in the current design. You can get
  the cells, nets, and other design objects that are associated with
  methodology violation objects, using the -of_objects option of the
  get_cells command for instance.

  The report_methodology command runs two default rule decks, or you can use
  the -checks option to specify the set of checks to run. Methodology checks
  can also be enabled or disabled in the default rule decks using the
  IS_ENABLED property on the rule check object:

    set_property IS_ENABLED FALSE [get_drc_checks PDRC-190]

  If a rule IS_ENABLED false, the rule will not be run by the
  report_methodology command.

  Note: You can reset the properties of a methodology rule to the factory
  default settings using the reset_drc_check command.

  You can reset the current results of the report_methodology command,
  clearing any found violations, using the reset_methodology command.

Arguments:

  -name <arg> - (Optional) The name to assign to the results when run in GUI
  mode.

  -checks <args> - (Optional) A list of rule checks to run the methodology
  report against. All specified rules will be checked against the current
  design. Rules are listed by their group name or full key. Using the -checks
  option creates a temporary user-defined rule deck, with the specified
  design rule checks, and uses the temporary rule deck for the run.

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the methodology report into the specified
  file. The specified file will be overwritten if one already exists, unless
  -append is also specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string rather than
  to the standard output. The Tcl string can be captured by a variable
  definition and parsed or otherwise processed.

  Note: This argument cannot be used with the -file option.

  -rpx <arg> - (Optional) Specify the file name and path of an Xilinx report
  file (RPX) to write. This is different from writing the report results to a
  file using the -file argument. The RPX file is an interactive report that
  contains all the report information and can be reloaded into memory in the
  Vivado Design Suite using the open_report command. You should add a .rpx
  file extension to the specified file name, as the Vivado tool will not
  automatically assign a file extension.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following examples run the default methodology checks against the
  current design, and writes the results to the specified file:

    report_methodology -file C:/Data/methodology_Rpt1.txt -append

  Note: The -append option adds the result to the specified file.
