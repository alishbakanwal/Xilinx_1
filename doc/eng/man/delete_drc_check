  User-defined design rule checks are created using the create_drc_checks
  command.

  command will not work.

  Note: This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it
  fails.

  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) Specify the name of a user-defined design rule check to
  be deleted from the current project.
