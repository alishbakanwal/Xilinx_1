Description:

  This command deletes the named AXI transaction objects, hw_axi_txn, from
  the specified hw_axi objects.

  The create_hw_axi_txn command cannot create an object of the same name as
  an existing object. Use this command to delete any existing objects prior
  to creating new AXI transaction objects.

  This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_axi_txns> - (Required) The hw_axi_txn objects to delete. The hw_axi_txn
  must be specified as an object returned by the get_hw_axi_txns command.

Example:

  The following example deletes the hw_axi_txn object associated with the
  specified hw_axi:

    delete_hw_axi_txn [get_hw_axi_txns readAxi1]
