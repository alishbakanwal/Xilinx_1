Description:

  Sets the maximum delay allowed on a timing path, specified in nanoseconds
  (ns). The specified delay value is assigned to both the rising and falling
  edges of the defined timing paths unless the -rise or -fall arguments are
  specified.

  The maximum rising and falling delay cannot be less than the minimum rising
  and falling delay on the same path, as defined by the set_min_delay
  command. If this happens, the first assigned constraint is removed from the
  timing path as a conflict, and the delay value specified by the removed
  constraint is set to 0.

  The delay value must be assigned to a timing path as defined by at least
  one -from, -through, or -to argument. A general path delay such as -to
  endpoint will be over written by a more specific path definition such as
  -from/-to, or -from/-through/-to path definition.

  Note: When assigned to a primary input or output port, any system-level
  delay consumes a portion of the max delay on the timing path that includes
  the input or output port. That is, the delay specified by set_input_delay
  or set_output_delay is considered part of the maximum delay.

  This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -rise - (Optional) Apply the delay value to the rising edge of the timing
  path.

  -fall - (Optional) Apply the delay value to the falling edge of the timing
  path.

  Note: If neither -rise nor -fall is specified, the delay is applied as both
  rising and falling edge path delay.

  -reset_path - (Optional) Indicates that existing rising or falling edge max
  delays should be cleared before applying the new specified path delay. If
  only -to is specified all paths leading to the specified endpoints are
  cleared. If only -from is specified, all paths leading from the specified
  start points are cleared. When -from/-to or -from/-through/-to are
  specified, the defined paths are reset.

  -from <value> - (Optional) A list of path start points or clocks. A valid
  startpoint is a primary input or inout port, or the clock pin of a
  sequential element. If a clock is specified then all the primary input and
  inout ports related to that clock as well as all the clock pin of the
  registers connected to that clock are used as startpoints.

  -rise_from <element_name> - (Optional) The max delay applied to paths
  rising from the list of origins or clocks.

  -fall_from <element_name> - (Optional) The max delay applied to paths
  falling from the list of origins or clocks.

  -to <element_name> - (Optional) A list of path endpoints or clocks. A valid
  endpoint is a primary output or inout port, or the data pin of a sequential
  element. If a clock is specified then all the primary output and inout
  ports related to that clock as well as all the data pins of the registers
  connected to that clock are used as endpoints.

  -rise_to <element_name> - (Optional) The max delay applied to paths with
  rise transition at the list of endpoints or clocks.

  -fall_to <element_name> - (Optional) The max delay applied to paths with
  fall transition at the list of endpoints or clocks.

  -through <element_name> - (Optional) A list of through pins, cells, or nets.

  -rise_through <element_name> - (Optional) The max delay applied to paths
  rising through pins, cells or nets.

  -fall_through <element_name> - (Optional) The max delay applied to paths
  falling through pins, cells or nets.

  -datapath_only - (Optional) Exclude clock skew and jitter from the delay
  calculation for the specified path. This option is used to constrain the
  delay between sequential elements that have different clocks, where you do
  not want to consider clock skew and jitter in the delay calculation. Only
  the Clock-to-Q delay of the first flop, the wire delay between the flops,
  and the setup time of the second flop should be considered.

  Note: The specification of the data path for -datapath_only must use the
  -from option to define the startpoint for the path. The hold check for the
  specified path is automatically defined as a false path when using the
  -datapath_only option.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <delay> - (Required) Specifies the maximum delay value specified in
  nanoseconds. The <delay> is specified in nanoseconds (ns) as a positive or
  negative floating point number, with a default value of 0.

Examples:

  The following example defines a maximum delay of 60 ns between all the
  input and output ports (feedthrough paths):

    set_max_delay 60 -from [all_inputs] -to [all_outputs]

  The following example clears the existing max delay and specifies a new >
  maximum delay for paths to endpoints clocked by the specified clock:

    set_max_delay -reset_path 50 -to [get_clocks spi_clk]

  The set_max_delay command is often used to define timing constraints for
  crossing clock domains when a simple synchronizer is used. In the following
  example, two flops (FF1 and FF2) are clocked by different clocks, and FF1/C
  connects directly to FF2/D through net1. To limit the delay on this
  connection to 4.0 ns use one of the following constraints:

    set_max_delay -from FF1 -to FF2 -datapath_only 4.0 
    set_max_delay -from FF1/C -to FF2/D -datapath_only 4.0
