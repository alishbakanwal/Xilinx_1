Description:

  Create a new wave configuration object in the current simulation, and open
  the waveform configuration in the Vivado IDE. This will make the new wave
  configuration object the current wave configuration.

  In the Vivado<tm tmtype="reg"/> simulator GUI, you can work with a waveform
  to analyze your design and debug your code. The Wave Config file contains
  the list of wave objects (signals, dividers, groups, virtual buses) to
  display, and their display properties, plus markers. A wave configuration
  displays with top-level HDL objects, and can be further populated using
  commands like add_wave and add_wave_divider. Any changes made to a wave
  configuration can be saved to a Wave Config file with the save_wave_config
  command.

  This command returns the name of the waveform configuration created, or an
  error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Optional) The name to give to the wave configuration object. If
  no <name> is specified, an untitled waveform configuration will be created,
  called "Untitled #", where # represents a numerical sequence beginning at
  1.

Examples:

  The following example creates a new wave configuration object with the
  specified name:

    create_wave_config testbench1
