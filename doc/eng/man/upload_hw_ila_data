Description:

  Upload the captured data from the memory buffers of the specified ILA debug
  cores on the Xilinx FPGA hardware device, and move it into a hw_ila_data
  object in the Vivado logic analyzer.

  You can upload captured data from the ILA debug core at any time during the
  capture process triggered by the run_hw_ila command. However, you may want
  to use the wait_on_hw_ila command in any Tcl scripts, to wait until the
  sample data buffers of the ILA core are fully populated with data. If you
  run the upload_hw_ila_data command prior to this, you may see a message as
  follows:

    INFO: [Labtools 27-1965] The ILA core `hw_ila_1` trigger was stopped by user \ 
    at 2014-Mar-06 08:59:30 
    INFO: [Labtools 27-2212] The ILA core `hw_ila_1` captured `6` windows with \ 
    `64` samples each, and a last partial window with `0` samples.

  The upload process creates a hw_ila_data object in the process of moving
  the captured data from the ILA debug core, hw_ila, on the physical FPGA
  device, hw_device. The hw_ila_data object is named after the hw_ila core it
  is uploaded from.

  Note: Each hw_ila object has only one matching hw_ila_data object
  associated with it. Each time upload_hw_ila_data is run for a specific
  hw_ila core, the hw_ila_data object is overwritten if it already exists.

  The data object, hw_ila_data can be viewed in the waveform viewer of the
  Vivado logic analyzer by using the display_hw_ila_data command, and can be
  written to disk using the write_hw_ila_data command.

  This command returns a hw_ila_data object, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_ilas> - (Optional) Specify one or more hw_ila objects to upload data
  from. The hw_ila objects can either be specified as objects returned by the
  get_hw_ilas or current_hw_ila commands, or specified by name. If the hw_ila
  is not specified, the data will be uploaded from the current_hw_ila.

Example:

  The following example arms the current hardware ILA debug core on the
  target hw_device, captures sample data at the probes as trigger events or
  capture conditions are encountered. Tcl script processing is suspended
  while sample data is captured, and then the data is uploaded from the
  hw_ila on the hw_device, into a hw_ila_data object:

    run_hw_ila -trigger_now [current_hw_ila] 
    wait_on_hw_ila [current_hw_ila] 
    upload_hw_ila_data [current_hw_ila]
