Description:

  Creates a wave group into a specified or current waveform configuration.
  New wave objects and wave_dividers can be added into the wave group to
  build up the waveform display.

  The wave group can be inserted at a specified location. If no location is
  specified the group is inserted at the end of the specified waveform
  configuration.

  The command returns the name of the newly created wave group object.

  Note: This command can only be used when running a simulation.

Arguments:

  -into <wcfgGroupVbusObj> - (Optional) Specifies the wave configuration,
  group, or virtual bus into which the new wave object(s) are inserted. If
  <wcfgGroupVbusObj> is a string instead of an object, it is treated as the
  name of a group in the current WCFG. If no such group is found, the tool
  searches the names of the virtual buses of the current WCFG. If still not
  found, the tool searches the names of all WCFG objects. If no -into object
  is specified, the current wave configuration is assumed.

  -at_wave <waveObj> - (Optional) Adds a wave group at a specified wave
  object. If <waveObj> is a string, it is treated as the display name of a
  wave object.

  -after_wave <waveObj> - (Optional) Adds a wave group after a specified wave
  object. If <waveObj> is a string, it is treated as the display name of a
  wave object.

  -before_wave <waveObj> - (Optional) Adds a wave group before a specified
  wave object. If <waveObj> is a string, it is treated as the display name of
  a wave object.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Optional) Creates a wave group with the specified display name.
  The default name is new_group.

Examples:

  Add a clk to the existing waveform configuration:

    add_wave_group clk 
     group10
