Description:

  Sets a default activity rate for a broad class of signals when performing
  power estimation.

  Note: This command operates silently and does not return direct feedback of
  its operation.

  The switching activity of a design affects both the static and dynamic
  power consumption. The static power is often dependent on logic state
  transitions, and the dynamic power is directly proportional to the toggle
  rate or switching activity.

  The current default switching activity attributes can be found by using the
  report_default_switching_activity command. The values can be set to their
  default values by using the reset_default_switching_activity command.

  Use the set_switching_activity command to define the activity of one or
  more signals, rather than the whole class.

Arguments:

  -toggle_rate <rate> - (Optional) The toggle rate describes how often the
  output switches relative to the controlling clock. Valid values are between
  0 and 200%. An output that switches once per clock cycle toggles at 100%.
  The toggle rate is directly used for power calculation for the specified
  type of signals.

  -static_probability <value> - (Optional) The static probability or
  percentage of the clock period that the output is at a logic value of `1`.
  Valid values are 0 < value < 1. A value of 0 means the output is always 0
  and a value of 1 means that the output is always 1. A clock port with a 50%
  duty cycle would have for example a value of 0.5. The static probability is
  used to calculate the propagation of the known switching activity (toggle
  rate) through all the nodes of the design and is therefore essential to
  perform power calculation.

  Note: One or both of -static_probability or -toggle_rate must be specified
  with the set_switching_activity command.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <type> - (Required) Specify the class of signals to apply the defined
  switching activity to. Valid values are: input, input_set, input_reset,
  input_enable, register, dsp, bram_read_enable, bram_write_enable,
  output_enable, clock, all.

Examples:

  The following example specifies a toggle rate of 85% for all DSP blocks:

    set_default_switching_activity -toggle_rate 85 dsp

  The following example specifies the toggle rate and switching probability
  for all supported types:

    set_default_switching_activity -toggle_rate 19 -static_probability .22 all
