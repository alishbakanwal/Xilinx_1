Description:

  Unmarks the specified object or objects that were previously marked by the
  mark_objects command. This command is for use in GUI mode.

  This command supports the color options as specified below. However, these
  options are not necessary to unmark a specific object, but can be used to
  unmark all objects currently marked in the specified color. See the example
  below.

Arguments:

  -rgb <args> - (Optional) The color to unmark in the form of an RGB code
  specified as {R G B}. For instance, {255 255 0} specifies the color yellow.

  -color <arg> - (Optional) The color to unmark. Supported highlight colors
  are red, green, blue, magenta, yellow, cyan, and orange.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - (Optional) One or more objects to be unmarked. If no objects
  are specified, all marked objects of the specified color will be unmarked.
  If no color is specified, all marked objects will be unmarked.
