Description:

  Convert a legacy IP object in the current project into a native IP object
  supported by Vivado. This does not convert IP in the catalog. Use this
  command to convert an existing design with legacy IP to take advantage of
  the native IP features of Vivado.

  You can only convert legacy IP if a native IP of the same version also
  exists. For example, to convert legacy IP blk_mem_gen v7.1, there must be a
  native IP of the same version.

  Note: This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it
  fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - The name of one or more IP cores in the current project to be
  converted from legacy to native form.

Examples:

  The example below converts all IP cores in the project from legacy to
  native format:

    convert_ip [get_ips]

  Note: An error is returned if the specified IP object is already in native
  format.
