Description:

  Reset the current project to its starting condition, with source and
  constraint files, by cleaning out the various output files created during
  synthesis, simulation, implementation, and write_bitstream. Also resets the
  state of the project to the start of the design flow.

  Note: Any user-defined Tcl variables that are in the global namespace (i.e.
  not in a project-specific namespace) are not reset or cleared by this
  command. Global variables are persistent with the invocation of Vivado and
  are only cleared when the Vivado Design Suite is closed. You can also use
  the unset command to expressly clear a specific Tcl variable.

Arguments:

  -exclude_runs - (Optional) Exclude the <project>.runs folder from the reset
  process. In this case, the runs folder will be preserved, while the rest of
  the project data will be removed.

  -exclude_ips - (Optional) Exclude the <project>.srcs/sources_1/ip folder
  from the reset process. In this case, the IP folder, containing the IP
  cores and generated targets, will be preserved, while the rest of the
  project data will be removed.

  -exclude_sim_runs - (Optional) Exclude the <project>.sim folder from the
  reset process. In this case, the simulation folder will be preserved, while
  the rest of the project data will be removed.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Example:

  The following example resets the current project, while preserving the
  simulation run data, and returning all messages regardless of message
  limits:

    reset_project -exclude_sim_runs -verbose
