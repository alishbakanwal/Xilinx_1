Description:

  Create a Verilog or VHDL wrapper for instantiating a sub-design into the
  project.

  The make_wrapper command will create a wrapper for DSP modules from System
  Generator or MathWorks MatLab, Embedded Processor Designs from the IP
  Integrator feature of the Vivado Design Suite, or any IP Integrator block
  design.

  You can generate a wrapper to make the sub-design the top-level of a
  stand-alone design, or for instantiating a sub-design into an existing
  design. You can also generate a wrapper for a simulation test bench of the
  sub-design.

  Note: The wrapper is generated in Verilog or VHDL according to the
  TARGET_LANGUAGE property on the project.

  The command returns information related to the creation of the wrappers, or
  returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -top - (Optional) Create a top-level Verilog or VHDL wrapper for the
  specified source. The wrapper instantiates the sub-design as the top-level
  of the design hierarchy.

  -testbench - (Optional) Create a simulation test bench template for the
  specified sub-design. This includes the DUT module instantiation, but does
  not include the stimulus for simulation.

  -inst_template - (Optional) Create an instantiation template for the
  specified source. The template will not be added to the project and will be
  generated for reference purposes only. The instantiation template can be
  cut and paste into another RTL file to create an instance of the module in
  the hierarchy.

  -fileset - (Optional) Specify the destination fileset for importing the
  wrapper file into the project. By default, the wrapper will be imported
  into sources_1.

  -import - (Optional) Import the wrapper file into the project, adding it to
  the appropriate fileset.

  -force - (Optional) Overwrite an existing wrapper file.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <files> - (Required) Specify the source files to generate the wrapper from.
  The make_wrapper command only supports the .mdl file format from System
  Generator for DSP, the .slx format from MathWorks MATLAB, and the .bd file
  format from the IP Integrator feature of the Vivado Design Suite.

Examples:

  The following example creates the instantiation template to integrate the
  specified IP Integrator block design into the design hierarchy of the
  current project:

    make_wrapper -inst_template -fileset [get_filesets sources_1] \ 
    -files [get_files C:/Data/design_1/design_1.bd]
