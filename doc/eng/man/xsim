Description:

  The xsim command loads a simulation snapshot to run a batch mode
  simulation, or to provide a GUI and/or Tcl-based interactive simulation
  environment. The snapshot must be generated using the xelab command.

Arguments:

  -view <arg> - (Optional) Open a wave configuration file to store the
  waveform activity for the simulation. The Wave Config file contains just
  the list of wave objects (signals, dividers, groups, virtual buses) to
  display, and their display properties, plus markers. A wave configuration
  file is written in the current simulation with the save_wave_config
  command.

  Note: This option may be repeated to open multiple Wave Config files.

  -autoloadwcfg - (Optional) When loading a wave database (WDB) file named
  <name>.wdb, automatically open all associated wave config files WCFG named
  <name>#.wcfg. This option is ignored if -view is also specified.

  -runall | -R - (Optional) Run the simulation until no event is left in the
  event queue, a breakpoint or valid condition is encountered, or a run time
  exception occurs. Then quit the simulator. This is the equivalent of `run
  -all; exit`.

  -maxdeltaid <arg> - (Optional) Specify the maximum number of delta cycles
  as an integer greater than 0. The default value is 10000.The simulator will
  report an error if it exceeds the specified maximum number of simulation
  loops, or delta cycles, at simulation run time. Refer to the Vivado Design
  Suite User Guide: Logic Simulation (UG900) for more information on delta
  cycles.

  -nolog - (Optional) This option is provided for compatibility with the
  command line XSIM utility, and is ignored when running in Tcl in the Vivado
  Design Suite.

  -maxlogsize <arg> - (Optional) The maximum size for a simulation log file,
  specified as a value in MBytes. The default value of -1, means the log file
  has no size limit.

  -onfinish [ stop | quit ] - (Optional) Specify the actions of the simulator
  upon finishing the simulation run. Valid values are stop the simulation, or
  quit the simulator. The default is stop.

  -onerror [ stop | quit ] - (Optional} Specify the actions of the simulator
  upon encountering an error. Valid values are stop the simulation, or quit
  the simulator. The default is stop.

  -tclbatch | -t - (Optional) Specify a TCL script file to run the simulator
  in batch mode.

  -testplusarg <args> - (Optional) Specify plusargs to be used by
  $test$plusargs and $value$plusargs system functions. These arguments are
  visually distinguished from other simulator arguments by starting with the
  plus (`+`) character.

  -vcdfile <arg> - (Optional) Specify a Value Change Dump (VCD) file to
  capture simulation output.

  -vcdunit <arg> - (Optional) Specify the time unit for the VCD output. The
  default unit is the same as the simulation engine precision.

  -wdb <arg> - (Optional) Specify the simulation waveform database (WDB)
  file. When the simulation completes, the simulation is written to a static
  simulator database file. The file can be opened for later review by the
  open_wave_database command.

  -tp - (Optional) Print the hierarchical names of process being executed to
  the standard output.

  -tl - (Optional) Print the file name and line number of statements being
  executed to the standard output.

  -nosignalhandlers - (Optional) Disables the installation of OS-level signal
  handlers in the simulation. With the signal handlers disabled, OS-level
  fatal errors could crash the simulation abruptly with little indication of
  the nature of the failure.

  Note: Use this option only if your security software prevents the simulator
  from running successfully.

  -ieeewarnings - (Optional) Enable warnings generated by the use of VHDL
  IEEE functions. Use this option to enable warnings that are disabled by
  default since these warnings can generally be ignored.

  -stats - (Optional) Display statistics related to memory and CPU usage upon
  exiting the simulator.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <snapshot> - (Required) The name of the simulation snapshot to be executed,
  or WDB file to be opened for viewing. The snapshot must have been
  previously compiled by xelab. The WDB file must have been previously saved
  using the -wdb option of the xsim command.

Examples:

  The following example launches xsim on the specified simulation snapshot:

    xsim C:/Data/project_xsim/project_xsim.sim/sim_1/behav/testbench_behav
