Description:

  Defines a Pblock to allow you to add logic instances for floorplanning
  purposes.

  You can add logic elements to the Pblock using the add_cells_to_pblock
  command, and then place the Pblocks onto the fabric of the FPGA using the
  resize_pblocks command. The resize_pblock command can also be used to
  manually move and resize Pblocks.

  You can nest one Pblock inside another for hierarchical floorplanning using
  the -parent option as shown in the first example. You can also nest an
  existing Pblock inside another Pblock using the set_property command to
  define the PARENT property as shown in the second example.

Arguments:

  -parent <arg> - (Optional) The name of the parent Pblock to allow creation
  of nested Pblocks. If the parent is not specified, the default parent of
  Root is assumed, placing the Pblock at the top of the design. You can use
  the get_pblocks command to report currently defined Pblocks that can be
  used as parents.

  Note: If the specified parent does not exist an error will be returned.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) The name of the Pblock to be created.

Examples:

  The following example creates a Pblock called Video1 inside another Pblock
  called Vid_Array:

    create_pblock -parent Vid_Array Video1

  The following example creates Pblocks called cpu1 and cpu2, and creates a
  third Pblock called cpuEngine. Then cpu1 and cpu2 are nested inside
  cpuEngine using the set_property command:

    create_pblock cpu1 
    create_pblock cpu2 
    create_pblock cpuEngine 
    set_property PARENT cpuEngine [get_pblocks {cpu1 cpu2}]
