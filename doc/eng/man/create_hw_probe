Description:

  This command creates a new user-defined probe on the specified ILA core to
  define triggers and view data in the Vivado Logic Analyzer. The new probe
  can combine specific bit values of existing probes to simplify or clarify
  the data presented in the waveform viewer. Captured data samples from the
  user-defined probe can be reported with the list_hw_samples command.

  User-defined probes can map bit values from a single physical probe on the
  ILA core, or can combine bit values from multiple physical probes onto a
  single user-defined probe. Probes that map bits from a single probe can be
  used to create triggers and view data. Probes that combine bits from
  multiple physical probes can only be used for viewing data in the Vivado
  Logic Analyzer.

  You can delete user-defined probes with the delete_hw_probes command.

  The create_hw_probe command returns the user-defined probe name when
  successful, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -no_gui_update - (Optional) Do not update the GUI in the Vivado logic
  analyzer to reflect the addition of the user-defined probe.

  -map <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the physical probe port name and signal
  bits to map into the new user-defined probe. Physical probe ports are the
  ports on the specified hw_ila object, and are related to signals being
  probed by the ILA core. The -map argument is specified as a list of
  physical probe port names and bits:

    -map {0011 probe3[19] probe3[6]}

  Note: The map can also include constant values as indicated above.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - Specifies the name to assign to the user-defined probe, as a
  combination of name and probe width, probeName[0:3] for instance. If no
  width is specified, the default probe width is one bit.

  Note: The user-defined probe width must match the number of bits specified
  in the -map argument.

  <core> - Specifies the ILA core object. The hw_ila can be specified by name
  or as an object returned by the get_hw_ilas command.

Examples:

  The following example maps bits from multiple physical probes onto a new
  user-defined probe on the specified ILA core:

    create_hw_probe -map {0011 probe5[3:0] probe8 probe9} myProbeAR[9:0] hw_ila_1

  Note: The -map option combines 10 bits onto the new probe, so the probe
  name specifies a matching port width.

  The following example creates a hw_probe with copies of the
  most-significant bit to sign-extend a 30-bit signal to align it with other
  32-bit signed signals:

    create_hw_probe -map {probe0[29] probe0[29] probe0[29:0]} \ 
    mySignExtendedProbe[31:0] [get_hw_ilas hw_ila_1]
