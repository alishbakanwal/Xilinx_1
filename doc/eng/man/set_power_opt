Description:

  Specify cell instances to include or exclude in power optimization. The
  specified cells are optimized using the power_opt_design command.

  Note: Block RAM optimizations are performed by default with the opt_design
  command. Some or all BRAM cells can be excluded from the opt_design
  optimization using the set_power_opt command as well.

  The effect of multiple set_power_opt commands is cumulative, so that you
  can specify a broad class of cell types to optimize, include specific
  hierarchical cells, and then exclude cells within the included hierarchy to
  refine the power optimization.

  The power optimizations that have been performed can be reported using the
  report_power_opt command.

Arguments:

  -include_cells <args> - (Optional) Include only these instances for clock
  gating. Use this option to list specific cells or blocks to be optimized
  using power_opt_design. The default is to include all cells in power
  optimization.

  -exclude_cells <args> - (Optional) Exclude these instances from clock
  gating. The default is to not exclude cells from power optimization. The
  -exclude_cells option excludes from the currently included cells. By
  default all cells are included, however, if -include_cells has been
  specified, then -exclude_cells applies only to the currently included
  cells.

  -clocks <args> - (Optional) Perform power optimizations on instances
  clocked by the specified clocks only. The default is to include all clocks
  in the design.

  Note: It is possible to use both -clocks and -include_cells to produce a
  list of cells that are not clocked by the specified clocks, resulting in no
  power optimization.

  -cell_types [ all | bram | reg | srl | none ] - (Optional) Perform power
  optimization on the specified cell types only. The default is to perform
  power optimization on all types of cells. You can use all or none to reset,
  or clear, any prior set_power_opt commands. You can also specify one or
  more of bram, srl, or reg type cells.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example sets power optimization for BRAM cells only, and then
  runs power optimization:

    set_power_opt -cell_types bram 
    power_opt_design

  The following example sets power optimization for BRAM and REG type cells,
  then adds SRLs, and runs power optimization. Then all cells are cleared,
  and only SRLs are included, and power optimization is run again:

    set_power_opt -cell_types { bram reg}  
    set_power_opt -cell_types { srl}  
    power_opt_design 
    set_power_opt -cell_types { none} 
    set_power_opt -cell_types { srl}  
    power_opt_design

  The following example sets power optimization for BRAM cells only, excludes
  the cpuEngine block from optimization, but then includes the
  cpuEngine/cpu_dbg_dat_i block, then performs power optimization:

    set_power_opt -cell_types bram 
    set_power_opt -exclude_cells cpuEngine 
    set_power_opt -include_cells cpuEngine/cpu_dbg_dat_i 
    power_opt_design
