Description:

  Create a new group to associate the specified TX to RX communication links
  on the IBERT debug core implemented on the current device.

  Vivado Serial I/O analyzer is a link-based analyzer. The links define the
  communication paths and protocols between transmitters and receivers of the
  GigaBit transceivers on the device. Link groups, or hw_sio_linkgroup
  objects, let you associate links into related groups, to collectively
  configure properties and run scans.

  This command returns the name of the linkgroup created, or returns an error
  if the command fails.

Arguments:

  -description <arg> - (Optional) Provide a brief description that acts as a
  label for the link group. This description is stored on the DESCRIPTION
  property of the hw_sio_linkgroup object.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_sio_links> - (Required) Specify one or more hw_sio_link objects to
  associate together as a group. The hw_sio_links must be specified as
  objects as returned by the create_hw_sio_link or get_hw_sio_links commands.

  Note: If you include a hw_sio_link object that already belongs to another
  linkgroup, the command will return an error.

Example:

  The following example uses the DESCRIPTION property on hw_sio_link objects
  to identify which links to add to a new link group:

    create_hw_sio_linkgroup -description "LoopBack Links" \ 
       [get_hw_sio_links -filter {DESCRIPTION == Link_12 || DESCRIPTION == \ 
       "Link 9" || DESCRIPTION == "Link 10" || DESCRIPTION == "Link 11" }]
