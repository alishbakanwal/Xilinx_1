Description:

  Note: The UNDO and REDO commands are intended for use in the Vivado IDE,
  and are not recommended for use in Tcl scripts to restore designs to a
  former state. To restore a design to a specific condition, you must write a
  design checkpoint using the write_checkpoint command, to be restored using
  read_checkpoint.

  Redo a command that has been previously undone. This command can be used
  repeatedly to redo a series of commands.

  If a command group has been created using the startgroup and endgroup
  commands, the redo command will redo the group of commands as a sequence.

Arguments:

  -list - (Optional) Get the list of commands that can be redone. When you
  use the undo command, the tool will step backward through a list of
  commands. The redo command can then be used to redo those commands.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example returns a list of commands that can be redone:

    redo -list
