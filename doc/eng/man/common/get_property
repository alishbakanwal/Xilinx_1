Description:

  Gets the current value of the named property from the specified object or
  objects. If multiple objects are specified, a list of values is returned.

  If the property is not currently assigned to the object, or is assigned
  without a value, then the get_property command returns nothing, or the null
  string. If multiple objects are queried, the null string is added to the
  list of values returned.

  If multiple objects are passed to the get_property command, you can use the
  -min or -max options to return the smallest or greatest value of the
  property specified by name. This feature can be useful when setting timing
  constraints.

  Note: For numeric properties, the min/max determination is based on numeric
  values. For all other properties, the determination is based on string
  sorting.

  This command returns a value, or list of values, or returns an error if it
  fails.

Arguments:

  -min - (Optional) When multiple <objects> are specified, this option
  examines the values of the property specified by <name>, and returns the
  smallest value from the list of objects. Numeric properties are sorted by
  value. All other properties are sorted as strings.

  -max - (Optional) When multiple <objects> are specified, this option
  examines the values of the property specified by <name>, and returns the
  largest value from the list of objects. Numeric properties are sorted by
  value. All other properties are sorted as strings.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) The name of the property to be returned. The name is
  not case sensitive.

  <objects> - (Required) One or more objects to examine for the specified
  property.

Examples:

  The following example gets the NAME property from the specified cell:

    get_property NAME [lindex [get_cells] 3]

  The following example returns the smallest PERIOD property from the
  specified clock objects:

    get_property -min PERIOD [get_clocks]

  This example demonstrates the string based sorting of the SITE property for
  the specified ports:

    get_property SITE [get_ports] 
    IOB_X1Y75 IOB_X1Y76 IOB_X1Y98 IOB_X1Y125 IOB_X0Y94 IOB_X1Y95 IOB_X1Y96 
    IOB_X1Y93 IOB_X1Y94 
     
    get_property -min SITE [get_ports] 
    IOB_X0Y94 
     
    get_property -max SITE [get_ports] 
    IOB_X1Y98

  Note: While IOB_X1Y125 is the largest site value on the port objects, the
  property value IOB_X1Y98 is returned because of the sorting of the property
  values as strings.
