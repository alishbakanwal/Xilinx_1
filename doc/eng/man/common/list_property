Description:

  Gets a list of all properties on a specified object or class.

  Note: report_property also returns a list of properties on an object or
  class of objects, but also reports the property type and property value.

Arguments:

  -class <arg> - (Optional) Return the properties of the specified class
  instead of a specific object. The class argument is case sensitive, and
  most class names are lower case.

  Note: -class cannot be used together with an <object>.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <object> - (Optional) A single object on which to report properties.

  Note: If you specify multiple objects you will get an error.

  <pattern> - (Optional) Match the available properties on the <object> or
  -class against the specified search pattern. The <pattern> applies to the
  property name, and only properties matching the specified pattern will be
  reported. The default pattern is the wildcard `*` which returns a list of
  all properties on the specified object.

  Note: The search pattern is case sensitive, and most properties are UPPER
  case.

Examples:

  The following example returns all properties of the specified CELL object:

    list_property [get_cells cpuEngine]

  The following example returns the properties matching the specified search
  pattern from the BEL class of objects:

    list_property -class bel *NUM*
