Description:

  Ends a sequence of commands that can be undone or redone as a series. Use
  startgroup to start the sequence of commands.

  You can have multiple command groups to undo or redo, but you cannot nest
  command groups. You must use endgroup to end a command sequence before
  using startgroup to create a new command sequence.

  Note: The startgroup /endgroup commands are provided to support sequences
  of related commands that can be undone via the undo command, or redone if
  needed using the redo command. However, some Tcl commands can trigger an
  endgroup unexpectedly, and certain commands do not support either UNDO or
  REDO. The limitations are not fully defined.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example defines a startgroup, executes a sequence of related
  commands, and then executes the endgroup. This sequence of commands can be
  undone as a group:

    startgroup 
    create_pblock pblock_wbArbEngine 
    create_pblock pblock_usbEng 
    add_cells_to_pblock pblock_wbArbEngine \ 
       [get_cells [list wbArbEngine]] -clear_locs 
    add_cells_to_pblock pblock_usbEng \ 
       [get_cells [list usbEngine1/usbEngineSRAM]] -clear_locs 
    endgroup
