Description:

  Send a message to the Tcl Console and the application log file.

  Use this command to send a specific message from a Tcl script for instance,
  under certain conditions.

  The command returns the specified message.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <id> - (Optional) Defines the message ID, including a prefix name, and
  numeric identifier. The ID consists of a pair of values: the first value
  can be an alphanumeric (with an underscore), the second value must be a
  number. The ID requires a dash between the two values, but cannot contain
  any other non-alphanumeric characters.

  <severity> - (Optional) Specifies the severity of the message to send.
  There are five message severities:

   *  ERROR - An ERROR condition implies an issue has been encountered which
      will render design results unusable and cannot be resolved without user
      intervention.

   *  {CRITICAL WARNING} - A CRITICAL WARNING message indicates that certain
      input/constraints will either not be applied or are outside the best
      practices for a FPGA family. User action is strongly recommended.

      Note: Since this is a two word value, it must be enclosed in {} or "".

   *  WARNING - A WARNING message indicates that design results may be
      sub-optimal because constraints or specifications may not be applied as
      intended. User action may be taken or may be reserved.

   *  INFO - An INFO message is the same as a STATUS message, but includes a
      severity and message ID tag. An INFO message includes a message ID to
      allow further investigation through answer records if needed.

   *  STATUS - A STATUS message communicates general status of the process
      and feedback to the user regarding design processing. A STATUS message
      does not include a message ID.

  <msg> - Defines the text of the message to send. The message must be
  enclosed in quotes ("") or braces ({}).

Examples:

  The following are some examples messages:

    send_msg_id {USER-23} "INFO" "This is a test message." 
    send_msg_id 22-22 WARNING "This is it!" 
    send_msg_id "MyApp-101" {CRITICAL WARNING} {Too much information.}
