Description:

  Reset the message count for the specified message ID to 0. This restarts
  the message counter toward the specified message limit. This can be used to
  reset the count of specific messages that may be reaching the limit, or
  reset the count of all messages returned by the tool.

  Every message delivered by the tool has a unique global message ID that
  consists of an application sub-system code and a message identifier. This
  results in a message ID that looks like the following:

    "Common 17-54" 
    "Netlist 29-28" 
    "Synth 8-3295"

  You can get the current message count for a specific message ID using the
  get_msg_count command.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <id> - (Required) Specifies the message ID to reset the count to 0. Specify
  * to reset the count of all messages to 0.

Examples:

  The following example resets the message count for all messages:

    reset_msg_count *
