Description:

  Restores a user-definable configuration parameter that has been changed
  with the set_param command to its default value.

  You can use the report_param command to see which parameters are currently
  defined.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) The name of a parameter to reset. You can only reset
  one parameter at a time.

Examples:

  The following example restores the tcl.statsThreshold parameter to its
  default value:

    reset_param tcl.statsThreshold
