Description:

  In order to reduce the memory footprint of the Vivado Design Suite, there
  are groups of Tcl commands called "features" which are unavailable for use
  until you run a command from that feature set, or unless you explicitly
  load the feature using the load_features command.

  This command lists the available features sets of the Vivado Design Suite
  that can be loaded with the load_features command.

  Note: If a feature has been previously loaded, it will not be listed as a
  feature available to load.

  This command returns a list of features, or an error message.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example returns the list of features available to load into
  the Vivado Design Suite:

    list_features
