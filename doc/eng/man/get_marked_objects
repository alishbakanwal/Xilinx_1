Description:

  Get the marked objects in the current design open in the Vivado IDE.
  Objects can be marked with the mark_objects command.

  You can get all marked objects in the design, or specify marked objects by
  color, or by RGB value.

  Note: This Tcl command works only when Vivado is run in GUI mode.

Arguments:

  -rgb <args> - (Optional) The color to use in the form of an RGB code
  specified as {R G B}. For instance, {255 255 0} specifies the color yellow,
  while {0 255 0} specifies green.

  -color <arg> - (Optional) The color used for marking the specified object
  or objects. Supported colors are: red, green, blue, magenta, yellow, cyan,
  and orange.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example gets all the marked objects in the current design:

    get_marked_objects

  The following example gets the object in the current design that are marked
  in the specified color:
