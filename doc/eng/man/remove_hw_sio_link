Description:

  Removes the specified communication links between TX and RX objects on the
  GTs of the IBERT debug core defined on the current hardware device.

  Vivado Serial I/O analyzer is a link-based analyzer, which lets you link
  between any transmitter and receiver within the IBERT design. The links
  define the communication paths and protocols between transmitters and
  receivers of the GigaBit transceivers on the device. This command removes
  those links.

  This command returns a list of link objects on the IBERT debug core, or
  returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_sio_links> - (Required) Specify one or more hw_sio_link objects to
  remove. The hw_sio_link must be specified as an object as returned by the
  create_hw_sio_link or get_hw_sio_links commands.

Example:

  The following example removes the specified communication link on the IBERT
  debug core:

    remove_hw_sio_link [get_hw_sio_links -filter {DESCRIPTION == "Link2"}]
