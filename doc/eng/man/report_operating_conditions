Description:

  Displays the real-world operating conditions that are used when performing
  analysis of the design.

  The environmental operating conditions of the device are used for power
  analysis when running the report_power command, but are not used during
  timing analysis. The values of operating conditions can be defined by the
  set_operating_conditions command.

  Note: By default the report is written to the Tcl console or STD output.
  However, the results can also be written to a file or returned as a string
  if desired.

Arguments:

  -voltage - (Optional) Report the list of voltage pairs. Supported voltage
  supplies vary by family.

  -grade - (Optional) Report the temperature grade of the target device

  -process - (Optional) Report the manufacturing process characteristics to
  be assumed.

  -junction_temp - (Optional) Report the device junction temperature used for
  modeling

  -ambient_temp - (Optional) Reports the environment ambient temperature

  -thetaja - (Optional) Report the Theta-JA thermal resistance used for
  modeling

  -thetasa - (Optional) Report the Theta-SA thermal resistance used for
  modeling

  -airflow - (Optional) Report the Linear Feet Per Minute (LFM) airflow to be
  used for modeling.

  -heatsink - (Optional) Report the heatsink type to be used for modeling.

  -thetajb - (Optional) Report the Theta-JB thermal resistance used for
  modeling

  -board - (Optional) Report the board size to be used for modeling.

  -board_temp - (Optional) Report the board temperature in degrees Centigrade
  to be used for modeling.

  -board_layers - (Optional) Report the number of board layers to be used for
  modeling

  -all - (Optional) Report the current values of all operating conditions.
  Use this to avoid having to report each condition separately.

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string rather than
  to the standard output. The Tcl string can be captured by a variable
  definition and parsed or otherwise processed.

  Note: This argument cannot be used with the -file option.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  Specify an industrial temperature grade device with an ambient temperature
  of 75 degrees C and then write those settings to a file on disk.

    set_operating_conditions -grade industrial -junction_temp 75 
    report_operating_conditions -grade -junction_temp -return_string -file \ 
    ~/conditions.txt
