Description:

  Read programming data off of the hardware configuration memory device,
  specified as a hw_cfgmem object.

  This command reads back the memory configuration file data programmed into
  a flash memory device by the program_hw_cfgmem command and writes it to the
  specified file. The memory configuration file is created by the
  write_cfgmem command and combines the bitstream (.bit) file, and any
  specified data files, into the memory configuration file format.

  Readback is the process of reading data from the configuration memory
  device to verify that the bitstream and any additional data files were
  properly programmed into the flash memory device.

Arguments:

  -checksum - (Optional) Calculate a checksum for the bitstream from the
  device.

  -force - (Optional) Force the overwriting of the specified file if one of
  the same name already exists.

  -all - (Optional) Read back all the address locations on the configuration
  memory device.

  Note: By default only the addresses defined by the configuration memory
  file (PROGRAM.FILE) of the specified hw_cfgmem object will be read back,
  although this can be affected by the -offset and -datacount options.

  -offset <arg> - (Optional) Memory address offset value to begin reading
  back from. The default offset address is 0x0.

  -file <arg> - (Required) Write the data read back from the hw_cfgmem object
  to the specified file. The readback file is similar to the MCS file created
  by the write_cfgmem command. The filename suffix should be either .mcs or
  .bin to reflect the format of the contents.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -format [ mcs | bin ] - (Optional) File format of the readback file to
  create. The default format is MCS.

  -datacount <arg> - (Optional) Specify the number of bytes to read back. The
  default is to read all data starting from the address specified by the
  -offset option.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_cfgmem> - (Optional) The hw_cfgmem object to read the data back from.
  The hw_cfgmem must be specified as an object as returned by the
  get_hw_cfgmems or current_hw_cfgmem commands. If the hw_cfgmem is not
  specified, the current_hw_cfgmem will be used.

Example:

  The following example creates a hw_cfgmem object associated with the
  current_hw_device ; sets a property defining the memory configuration file
  (PROGRAM.FILE) previously created from the bitstream with the write_cfgmem
  command; sets other properties of the hw_cfgmem object for use during the
  readback process; and programs the current hw_device with the cfgmem
  bitstream:

    create_hw_cfgmem -hw_device [current_hw_device] \ 
       [lindex [get_cfgmem_parts {n25q128-3.3v-spi-x1_x2_x4}] 0] 
    set cfgMem [current_hw_cfgmem] 
    set_property PROGRAM.FILE {C:/Data/config_n25q128.mcs} $cfgMem 
    set_property PROGRAM.ADDRESS_RANGE  {use_file} $cfgMem 
    set_property PROGRAM.BLANK_CHECK  1 $cfgMem 
    set_property PROGRAM.ERASE  1 $cfgMem 
    set_property PROGRAM.CFG_PROGRAM  1 $cfgMem 
    set_property PROGRAM.VERIFY  1 $cfgMem 
    create_hw_bitstream -hw_device [current_hw_device] \ 
       [get_property PROGRAM.HW_CFGMEM_BITFILE [current_hw_device]] 
    program_hw_devices [current_hw_device]

  Note: The hw_cfgmem object is assigned to the Tcl variable $cfgMem.

  The following example reads back the current hw_cfgmem object using the
  addresses defined in the object`s PROGRAM.FILE property:

    readback_hw_cfgmem -format mcs \ 
       -file C:/Data/design1.mcs [current_hw_cfgmem]

  The following example reads back all the addresses from the current
  hw_cfgmem object, starting at address 0 and up to the maximum memory depth:

    readback_hw_cfgmem -all -format mcs \ 
       -file C:/Data/design1.mcs [current_hw_cfgmem]

  The following example reads back a select range of addresses from the
  current hw_cfgmem object:

    readback_hw_cfgmem -offset 0x084 -datacount 100 -format mcs \ 
       -file C:/Data/design1.mcs [current_hw_cfgmem]
