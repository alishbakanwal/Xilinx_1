Description:

  Selects the specified object in the appropriate open views in the GUI mode.
  This command is for display purposes only. You must use the
  get_selected_objects command to return the selected objects for use in
  other commands.

  The select_objects command may select secondary objects in addition to the
  primary object specified. The selection of secondary objects is controlled
  through the use of Selection Rules defined in the Tools > Options command.
  Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Using the IDE (UG893) for more
  information on Setting Selection Rules.

  Selected objects can be unselected with the unselect_objects command.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - (Required) Specifies one or more objects to be selected.
