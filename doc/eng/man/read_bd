Description:

  Read the specified IP subsystem design files, or block designs, into the
  current project or the in-memory design. This command is similar to the
  add_files command. The block design file is added to the source fileset as
  it is read.

  Note: Files are read and referenced from their current location, and are
  not moved into the local project directories. To bring the file into the
  local project, use the import_files command instead.

  You can use this command to read block designs into the in-memory design,
  when running the Vivado tool in Non Project mode, in which there is no
  project file to maintain and manage the various project source files. Refer
  to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Design Flows Overview (UG892) for
  more information on Non Project mode.

  This command returns the name of the IP subsystem design files read, or
  returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <files> - Specify the name of the IP subsystem files to read into the
  current project or in-memory design.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the tool will
  search for the specified file in the current working directory and then in
  the directory from which the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example reads the specified IP subsystem design into the
  current project:

    
    read_bd C:/Data/block_designs/design1.bd
