Description:

  The stop command pauses the current simulation. This command can be used
  within a condition, defined by add_condition, to pause the simulation when
  the condition is true.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example defines a condition named resetLow, that becomes true
  when the reset signal is low, and then puts a message to the standard
  output, and stops the current simulation:

    add_condition -name resetLow {/testbench/reset == 0 } { 
    puts "Condition Reset was encountered at [current_time]. \ 
       Stopping simulation." 
    stop }
