Description:

  Selects the specified object in the Waveform window of the Vivado IDE. This
  command is for selecting displayed items in the Waveform window only, and
  is similar to the select_objects command in the Vivado IDE.

  Note: Use the get_hdl_objects command to select simulation objects in the
  open simulation, or current_sim.

  Unselect selected objects using the select_wave_objects command with an
  empty string:

    select_wave_objects ""

  This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <items> - (Required) Specifies one or more items in the Waveform window to
  be selected. Items are specified by name. Specifying an empty string
  unselects all currently selected waveform objects.

Examples:

  The following example selects the specified site on the device:

    select_wave_objects {sys_clk_p sysc_clk_n}
