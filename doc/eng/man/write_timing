Description:

  Write the results of timing analysis to the specified file. This command
  writes the results from timing analysis previously created by the
  report_timing command; it does not actually run timing analysis.

  write_timing produces a legacy timing path report. The format of this file
  is different from the output of the report_timing -file command.

Arguments:

  -force - Overwrite the timing file if it already exists.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - The name of the results set created by the report_timing command.
  These are the timing results that will be output to the specified file.

  <file> - The filename of the timing file to write.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example runs timing analysis and creates a timing results set
  called time_1, then writes the named timing results to the specified file:

    report_timing -name time_1 
    write_timing time_1 C:/Data/FPGA_Design/bft_time_1.txt
