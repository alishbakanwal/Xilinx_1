Description:

  Read a hardware SIO scan data file and create a hw_sio_scan object in the
  Hardware Manager feature of the Vivado Design Suite.

  The SIO scan data can be written to disk using the write_hw_sio_scan
  command, after running the scan using the run_hw_sio_scan command. This
  command reads that data file.

  If no hw_sio_scan object is specified, a new hw_sio_scan object is created
  and is named sequentially following any existing hw_sio_scan objects. After
  being read from disk, the SIO scan data can be plotted and viewed in the
  Vivado serial I/O analyzer by using the display_hw_sio_scan command.

  This command returns a hw_sio_scan object, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - (Required) The name of SIO scan data file to read. If the file
  extension is not specified, the Vivado tool assumes an extension of .csv.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the tool will
  search for the specified file in the current working directory and then in
  the directory from which the tool was launched.

  <hw_sio_scan> - (Optional) Specify an existing hw_sio_scan object to read
  the scan data file into. The hw_sio_scan object can be specified by name,
  or as an object returned by the get_hw_sio_scans command.

Example:

  The following example reads the specified SIO scan data file into an
  existing hw_sio_scan object:

    read_hw_sio_scan C:/Data/LoopBack1.csv SCAN_0
