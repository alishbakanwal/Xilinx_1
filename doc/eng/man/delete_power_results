Description:

  Deletes the power analysis results for the specified results set.

  Note: This command operates silently and does not return direct feedback of
  its operation

Arguments:

  -name <arg> - (Required) The name of the results set to delete. This name
  was either explicitly defined, or was automatically defined when the
  report_power command was run.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example runs power analysis, and then clears the results:

    report_power -name my_set 
    delete_power_results -name my_set
