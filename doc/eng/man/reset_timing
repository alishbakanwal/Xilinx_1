Description:

  Reset the timing data and constraints for the current design. Use this
  command to clear the current in-memory timing data and constraints, and
  force the timing engine to reevaluate the design comprehensively rather
  than iteratively.

  After clearing the constraints from the in-memory design, you must reload
  any needed constraints using the read_xdc command. The Vivado tool will not
  automatically reload the constraints.

  Note: This command deletes the in-memory timing view, not the timing
  report. Use the delete_timing_results command to delete the reported timing
  information.

Arguments:

  -invalid - (Optional) Remove the invalid timing constraints as well as the
  valid timing constraints when resetting the design. Invalid constraints
  contain an error or are assigned to missing design objects, and are ignored
  by the Vivado timing engine at the time the XDC file is read, and so do not
  affect timing results. Resetting invalid constraints removes them from the
  in-memory design, so they will be lost if not previously saved to a
  constraints file.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example clears the current timing data from memory, including
  any invalid timing constraints:

    reset_timing -invalid
