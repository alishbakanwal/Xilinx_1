Description:

  Provides a utility to manage user defined DRC rules. This command allows
  you to enable or disable previously registered rules for a specific DRC
  abbreviation. Enabled rules will be checked for violations when report_drc
  is run. Disabled rules will not be checked for violations.

  You can also use the -list_rules argument to list the currently registered
  rules available to enable or disable for the specified DRC abbreviation.

Arguments:

  -action [ register | unregister ] - Select register to enable, or
  unregister to disable a user-defined DRC rule that has been previously
  registered using the register_drc_rule command.

  -abbrev <arg> - The unique abbrev for the user-defined rule in the
  violation library. This should match the name of the rule specified in the
  register_drc_rule command.

  -rules <args> - The list of rules to enable or disable. The -rules argument
  is used with the -action argument to specify the rules to enable or disable
  for the specified abbreviation. The specified rules must be associated with
  the abbreviation, or an error will be returned. Rules are associated with
  abbreviations using the register_drc_rule command.

  -list_rules [ all | enabled ] - List the rules associated with the
  specified abbreviation. List all rules, or only those that are currently
  enabled. Use -list_rules in place of the -action and -rules arguments to
  list the rules currently registered with the specified DRC abbreviation.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example lists all rules currently registered with the
  specified abbreviation:

    manage_user_drc_rule -abbrev ABCD -list_rules all

  The following example disables both rule1 and rule2 for the specified
  abbreviation:

    manage_user_drc_rule -abbrev ABCD -enable unregister -rules {rule1 rule2}

  The following example enables rule1 for the specified abbreviation:

    manage_user_drc_rule -abbrev ABCD -enable register -rules {rule1}
