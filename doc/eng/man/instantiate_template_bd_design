Description:

  This command creates an example design from a template Block Design in the
  IP integrator feature of the Vivado Design Suite.

  The template diagram is created in an existing and open block design. In
  addition, the target part specified by the current project or in-memory
  project must be compatible with the template design or an error is
  returned.

  The command returns a transcript of its process, or returns an error if it
  fails.

Arguments:

  -design <arg> - (Required) Specifies the name of the block design to
  instantiate the template diagram into. The specified block design must
  exist and be open in the IP integrator, or an error is returned.

  -hier - (Optional) Hierarchy Block

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <template> - Specifies the template diagram to be instantiated into the
  specified design. The template can be specified by name, or as an object
  specified by the get_template_db_designs command.

Examples:

  The following example builds the specified template block design in the
  specified design:

    instantiate_template_bd_design -design myFirstZynq \ 
    [lindex [get_template_bd_designs] 1]
