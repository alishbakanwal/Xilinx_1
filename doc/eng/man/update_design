Description:

  This command updates the in-memory design, replacing the current netlist in
  the specified cells with a netlist from a specified file, from another open
  design, from a specified cell of a design, or converts the cells to a black
  box cell.

  The update_design command can update a single instance, or a list of
  instances, or can update all instances of a master cell.

  Only the in-memory view of the design is changed by the new netlist. You
  must save the design using the write_checkpoint command, or any updates
  will be lost when you close the project or exit the tool.

Arguments:

  -cells <args> - (Required) Defines a list of hierarchical leaf-cell names,
  or cell objects, to update with the specified netlist. To update all
  instances of a cell, use the get_cells command with the -filter argument to
  specify the master cell:

    get_cells -hier -filter {ref_name==aMasterCellName} <cell_name>

  -strict - (Optional) Require the new netlist to have exactly the same ports
  as cells it is imported into. The tool will perform some checking on the
  new netlist to insure that the specified netlist has all the ports required
  for the specified cells. However, additional ports are also permitted,
  unless the -strict option is used.

  -from_file - (Optional) Name of a file containing the new netlist. The
  netlist can be in the form of a structured Verilog netlist (.v) or an EDIF
  netlist (.edf) file.

  Note: -from_file and -from_design are mutually exclusive.

  -from_design - (Optional) Allows you to import the netlist from another
  open design in the current project. The design must be opened in the
  current tool invocation, and not a separate process.

  -from_cell - (Optional) Name of a cell in the design specified with
  -from_design. The netlist from the specified cell will be used to update
  the cells in the current design. By default the tool will use the top-level
  cell of the design specified in -from_design.

  Note: This option can only be used with -from_design.

  -black_box - (Optional) Change the specified cells into black box cells.

  -buffer_ports - (Optional) Insert buffers for all the ports of a black box
  cell.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  This example replaces a black box cell with the netlist from the specified
  file:

    update_design -from_file C:/Data/cell_contents.v -cells black_box_cell

  The following example updates the netlist in the arnd4 cell with the
  specified Verilog netlist:

    update_design -cells arnd4 -from_file C:/Data/round_4.v

  The following example updates the arnd4 cell in the current design with the
  netlist from the same cell in the specified design:

    update_design -cells arnd4 -from_design netlist_2 -from_cell arnd4
