Description:

  Report the calculated bus skew among the signals constrained by set_bus_skew.

  The bus skew requirement applies to both the slow and fast corners. The
  Vivado tool determines the earliest and the latest arrival among all the
  signals of the bus and calculates the bus skew for both the Slow and Fast
  process corner, and reports the worst case skew. Each signal of the bus is
  reported relative to a reference signal from the same bus. Note that the
  reference signal can be different for each signal of the bus, which ever
  results in the worst bus skew for that signal.

  The bus skew report can be written to the Tcl console or command shell,
  assigned to a return string, or saved to a file.

  This command returns the bus skew report as specified, or returns an error
  if it fails.

Arguments:

  -delay_type <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the type of delay to analyze when
  running the bus skew report. The valid values are min, max, min_max,
  max_rise, max_fall, min_rise, min_fall. The default setting for -delay_type
  is max.

  -setup - (Optional) Check for setup violations. This is the same as
  specifying -delay_type max.

  -hold - (Optional) Check for hold violations. This is the same as
  specifying -delay_type min.

  Note: -setup and -hold can be specified together, which is the same as
  specifying -delay_type min_max.

  -no_detailed_paths - (Optional) By default the bus skew report includes
  detailed path analysis for the signals reported. This option disables the
  detailed path in the bus skew report.

  -max_paths <arg> - (Optional) The maximum number of paths to report per
  constraint. This is specified as a value greater than or equal to 1. By
  default the report_bus_skew command will report the single worst timing
  path per bus skew constraint.

  -nworst <arg> - (Optional) The number of timing paths per endpoint to
  output in the bus skew report. The report will return the <N> worst paths
  based on the specified value, greater than or equal to 1. The default
  setting is 1.

  -unique_pins - (Optional) Show only one timing path for each unique set of
  pins.

  -path_type <arg> - (Optional) Specify the path data to output in the bus
  skew report. The default format is full_clock_expanded. The valid path
  types are:

   *  short - Displays the startpoints and endpoints with calculated timing
      values.

   *  full - Displays the full timing path, including startpoints, through
      points, and endpoints.

   *  full_clock - Displays full clock paths in addition to the full timing
      path.

   *  full_clock_expanded - Displays full clock paths between a master clock
      and generated clocks in addition to the full_clock timing path. This is
      the default setting.

  -input_pins - (Optional) Show input pins in the timing path report. For use
  with -path_type full, full_clock, and full_clock_expanded.

  -no_header - (Optional) Do not write a header to the report.

  -slack_lesser_than <arg> - (Optional) Report timing on bus signals with a
  calculated slack value less than the specified value. Used with
  -slack_greater_than to provide a range of slack values of specific
  interest. The slack of a bus signal is the difference between the bus skew
  requirement for the bus and the actual bus skew for that signal.

  -slack_greater_than <arg> - (Optional) Report timing on bus signals with a
  calculated slack value greater than the specified value. Used with
  -slack_lesser_than to provide a range of slack values of specific interest.
  The slack of a bus signal is the difference between the bus skew
  requirement for the bus and the actual bus skew for that signal.

  -significant_digits <arg> - (Optional) The number of significant digits in
  the output results. The valid range is 0 to 3. The default setting is 3
  significant digits.

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file. The
  specified file will be overwritten if one already exists, unless -append is
  also specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string rather than
  to the standard output. The Tcl string can be captured by a variable
  definition and parsed or otherwise processed.

  Note: This argument cannot be used with the -file option.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example reports the bus skew for the 32 worst signals of each
  bus skew constraints in the design, reporting 1 path per bit of the bus
  with the full timing path, including input pins, with timing values:

    report_bus_skew -max 32 -nworst 1 -path_type full -input_pins
