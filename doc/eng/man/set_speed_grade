Description:

  Note: After set_speed_grade has been used on a design, it can be used for
  timing analysis, but it will no longer go through implementation. If you
  want to run implementation on the design, you should save the design
  checkpoint and use read_checkpoint -part to implement the design with the
  new speed grade.

  Sets the speed grade used for timing analysis for the target device in the
  current design.

  This command is used to change the speed grade of the target device for
  timing analysis only, and does not affect other aspects of the design. It
  must be run on an opened synthesized or implemented design.

  Use the set_speed_grade command prior to the report_timing_summary or
  report_timing command or other timing commands to change the speed grade
  for analysis. If the timing is valid, then you can use the set_property or
  set_part command to change the target part for the project to re-synthesize
  and implement the design.

  Note: For UltraScale devices, you can specify either the temperature or the
  value to define the speed grade for the part. For 7 series devices, you can
  only specify the value.

  This command returns a transcript of its process, and the speed grade set,
  or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -temperature - (Optional) Specify the temperature grade for UltraScale
  devices, used for timing analysis.

  Note: This option is not available for 7 series devices, or earlier.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <value> - (Optional) The speed grade for the target device. Typical values
  are -1, -1L, -2, or -3. Specifying an incorrect value (e.g. -999) will
  cause the command to return an error message with a list of valid values
  for the current part.

Examples:

  The following example sets the speed grade for the device in the current
  design to -1:

    
    set_speed_grade -1
