Description:

  Deletes the specified run from the project, and deletes all results of the
  run from the project directory on the hard drive unless otherwise
  specified.

Arguments:

  -noclean_dir - Do not delete the run results from the hard drive. The run
  will be deleted from the project, but the run files will remain in the
  project directory.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <run> - (Required) The name of the synthesis or implementation run to
  delete from the project.

Examples:

  The following example deletes the first_pass run from the project:

    delete_run first_pass

  Note: In this example, all run results will also be removed from the
  project directory on the hard drive.

  The following command deletes the first_pass run, but leaves the run
  results on the hard drive:

    delete_run -noclean_dir first_pass
