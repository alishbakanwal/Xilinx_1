Description:

  Close the current, or specified wave configuration.

  In the Vivado<tm tmtype="tm"/> simulator GUI, you can work with a waveform
  to analyze your design and debug your code. A wave configuration object
  displays with top-level HDL objects, and can be further populated using
  commands like add_wave and add_wave_divider. A new wave configuration
  object can be created in the current simulation with the create_wave_config
  command.

  Any changes made to a wave configuration object can be saved to a Wave
  Config file with the save_wave_config command. You can open a saved Wave
  Config file with the open_wave_config command.

Arguments:

  -force - (Optional) Forces the closing of the Wave Config file, even if
  changes would be lost. The default behavior is to return an error if
  unsaved changes would be lost.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <wcfgobj> - (Optional) Specify a Wave Config object to close. The default
  is to close the current Wave Config file as returned by the
  current_wave_config command.

  Note: The wave configuration must be specified as an object using the
  get_wave_configs command.

Examples:

  The following example closes all Wave Config files associated with the
  current simulation:

    close_wave_config [get_wave_configs]
