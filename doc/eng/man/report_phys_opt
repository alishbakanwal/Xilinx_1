Description:

  Reports the results of the fanout driver replication and load
  redistribution optimizations performed by the phys_opt_design command.

Arguments:

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the physical optimization report into the
  specified file. The specified file will be overwritten if one already
  exists, unless -append is also specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output of the report to a Tcl
  string. The Tcl string can be captured by a variable definition and parsed
  or otherwise processed.

  Note: This argument cannot be used with the -file option.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example reports the physical optimizations performed in the
  current design by the phys_opt_design command:

    report_phys_opt -file C:/Data/physOpt_Report.txt
