Description:

  Validate an IP Integrator subsystem design, or IP cell or hierarchical
  module.

  This command returns success, and TCL_OK if successful, or TCL_ERROR if it
  fails, unless -quiet is specified.

Arguments:

  -force - (Optional) Force validation on the block design.

  -design <arg> - (Optional) The IP Integrator subsystem design to validate.
  If not specified, the current IP Integrator subsystem design is validated.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example validates the IP Integrator subsystem design, and
  returns a few warnings and errors related to the design:
