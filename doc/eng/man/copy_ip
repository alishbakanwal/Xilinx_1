Description:

  Create a copy of an IP core that has been previously instanced into the
  current project.

Arguments:

  -name <arg> - (Required) Specify the name of the new IP to be created.

  -dir <arg> - (Optional) The path to a directory outside of the local
  project to store the newly created IP. The specified directory must already
  exist, or the command will return an error.

  Note: If a directory is not specified, the new IP will be added to the
  local project directory structure at <project_name> .srcs/sources_1/ip.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <object> - (Required) The IP object to copy. The copy_ip command can only
  be used to copy a single IP core at one time. The IP must be specified as
  an IP object returned by the get_ips command, and not simply referenced by
  name.

Example:

  The following example create a copy of the FIFO core previously instanced
  into the current project and writes it to the specified directory:

    copy_ip -name newFIFO -dir C:/Data/new_IP [get_ips oldFIFO]
