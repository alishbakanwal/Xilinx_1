Description:

  Defines the current hardware server from the list of hardware servers that
  are connected to the Vivado Design Suite, or returns the currently
  connected hardware server object.

  Hardware servers are instances of the Xilinx hardware server (hw_server)
  application running remotely, or on the local machine. The hardware server
  manages connections to a hardware target, such as a hardware board
  containing a JTAG chain of one or more Xilinx devices to be used for
  programming and debugging your FPGA design.

  Hardware servers are connected to the Vivado Design Suite with the
  connect_hw_server command. The current hardware server, and the current
  hardware target and device are the focus of most Hardware Manager Tcl
  commands. The current target and device can be defined using the
  current_hw_target and current_hw_device commands.

  Note: There is usually a current hw_server defined, either the last
  connected hardware server, or one you have defined with this command.
  However, if you disconnect the current hardware server, you will need to
  define a new current hw_server object.

  You can get a list of connected hardware servers using the get_hw_servers
  command. You can get a list of available hardware targets and devices using
  the get_hw_targets and get_hw_devices commands respectively.

  This command returns a hw_server object. If the <hw_server> is specified as
  part of the current_hw_server command, the specified server is defined as
  the current hardware server and that object is returned. If no server is
  specified, the current_hw_server command returns the current hardware
  server object.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_server> - (Optional) The hw_server to set as the current hardware
  server. If the server is not specified, the command will return the
  currently defined hw_server. The hardware server can be specified by name,
  or specified as a hw_server object returned by the get_hw_servers command.

Example:

  The following example sets the current hardware server to the specified name:

    current_hw_server picasso

  The following returns the current hardware server:

    current_hw_server
