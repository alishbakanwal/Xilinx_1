Description:

  Sets false timing paths in the design that are ignored during timing
  analysis.

  Note: This command operates silently and does not return direct feedback of
  its operation

Arguments:

  -setup - (Optional) Eliminate setup timing analysis for specified timing
  paths.

  -hold - (Optional) Eliminate hold timing analysis for specified timing paths.

  -rise - (Optional) Eliminate rising delays for the specified timing paths.

  -fall - (Optional) Eliminate falling delays for the specified timing paths.

  -reset_path - (Optional) Reset the timing path before setting false path.
  This clears all exception-based timing constraints from the defined timing
  path.

  -from <element_name> - (Optional) List of path origins or clocks. A valid
  startpoint is a clock object, the clock pin of sequential logic, or an
  input or bidirectional port.

  -rise_from <element_name> - (Optional) Apply to paths rising from the list
  of origins or clocks

  -fall_from <element_name> - (Optional) Apply to paths falling from the list
  of origins or clocks

  -to <element_name> - (Optional) List of path endpoints or clocks

  -rise_to <element_name> - (Optional) Apply to paths with rise transition at
  the list of endpoints or clocks

  -fall_to <element_name> - (Optional) Apply to paths with fall transition at
  the list of endpoints or clocks

  -through <element_name> - (Optional) List of through pins, cells or nets

  -rise_through <element_name> - (Optional) Apply to paths rising through
  pins, cells or nets

  -fall_through <element_name> - (Optional) Apply to paths falling through
  pins, cells or nets

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example eliminates the setup timing for paths from the bftClk:

    set_false_path -setup -from bftClk

  The following example excludes paths between the two clocks from timing
  analysis:

    set_false_path -from [get_clocks GT0_RXUSRCLK2_OUT] \ 
       -to [get_clocks DRPCLK_OUT]
