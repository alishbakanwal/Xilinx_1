Description:

  This command generates target data for the specified IP objects (get_ips)
  or source file for IP cores (.xci and .xco), DSP modules (.slx or .mdl), or
  block designs (.bd). The target data that is generated are the files
  necessary to support the IP or block design through the FPGA design flow.

  The instantiation template, synthesis netlist, and simulation netlist are
  standard targets. However, each IP in the catalog may also support its own
  set of targets. You can view the available targets on an object by
  examining the SUPPORTED_TARGETS property, or you can use the list_targets
  command to list the targets for design source file.

Arguments:

  -force - (Optional) Force target data regeneration, and overwrite any
  existing target data files. Without -force, the tool will not regenerate
  any target data that is up-to-date.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) The names of the types of target data to create for the
  specified source. The specific targets supported by an IP core are listed
  in the SUPPORTED_TARGETS property on the object. You can query this
  property to see which targets a specific object supports. Standard values
  are:

   *  all - Generate all targets for the specified IP or file, except the
      example project.

      Note: You can generate an example project for an IP core using the
      open_example_project command.

   *  instantiation_template - Generate the Instantiation template used to
      add the RTL module definition for the IP core into the current design.
      The instantiation template can be copied into any desired level of the
      design hierarchy.

   *  synthesis - Synthesis targets deliver HDL files that are used during
      synthesis for native IP, or deliver a synthesized netlist file (DCP)
      generated by Vivado synthesis.

   *  simulation - Simulation targets deliver HDL files that are used in
      simulation.

   *  implementation - Implementation generates the necessary data for
      implementing the IP core, DSP module, or Embedded Processor in the
      current design.

  <objects> - (Required) The objects to generate the target from. Supported
  objects can include IP core objects (get_ips), or the source files (.xci or
  .xco), block design files (.bd) from IP Integrator, and DSP modules (.slx
  or .mdl) imported from System Generator.

  Note: Use get_files to specify a file object, rather than specifying a file
  name.

Examples:

  This example generates the change log for all of the IP cores in the
  current project, forcing regeneration of any targets that are up-to-date:

    generate_target changelog [get_ips] -force

  The following example generates the instantiation template and synthesis
  targets for all of the IP cores in the current project:

    generate_target {instantiation_template synthesis} [get_ips]

  Note: Note the use of the braces to pass the list of targets to the
  command. The absence of the -force option means that only out-of-date
  targets will be regenerated.

  The following example generates all targets for the specified block design:

    generate_target all \ 
    [get_files  C:/Data/project_mb/project_mb.srcs/sources_1/bd/base_mb/base_mb.bd]

  Note: The use of get_ips is not supported to generate targets for
  individual IP within block designs. The tool will return an error.

  The following queries the SUPPORTED_TARGETS property of the specified IP
  object, and then generates the example project for the IP:

    get_property SUPPORTED_TARGETS [get_ips blk_mem*] 
    open_example_project -dir C:/Data/examples -force [get_ips blk_mem*]
