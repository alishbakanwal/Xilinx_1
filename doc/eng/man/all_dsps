Description:

  Returns a list of all DSP cell objects that have been declared in the
  current design.

  The list of DSPs returned by all_dsps can also be limited or reduced by the
  filter command to filter according to properties assigned to the DSP
  objects. Properties of an object can be returned by the list_property or
  report_property commands.

  The all_dsps command is scoped to return the objects hierarchically, from
  the top-level of the design or from the level of the current instance. By
  default the current instance is defined as the top level of the design, but
  can be changed by using the current_instance command.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example returns a list of all DSPs defined in the current
  design, and filters that list to return a single DSP assigned to the
  specified SITE:

    filter [all_dsps] {SITE == DSP48_X1Y6}

  The following example shows how the list returned can be passed to another
  command:

    set_false_path -from [all_dsps] -to [all_registers]
