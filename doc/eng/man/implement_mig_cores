Description:

  Implements the memory IP cores in the current project.

  Memory IP included in the Xilinx IP Catalog are used to generate memory
  controllers and interfaces for Xilinx<tm tmtype="reg"/> devices. Memory IP
  includes different IP cores from the Xilinx IP catalog depending on the
  device architecture and memory interface specified. Refer to Zynq-7000 AP
  SoC and 7 Series Devices Memory Interface Solutions (UG586), or UltraScale
  Architecture-Based FPGAs Memory Interface Solutions (PG150), for details of
  the available memory IP.

  The implement_mig_cores command generates the RTL information for the
  physical interface (PHY) of the memory controller, and integrates the
  synthesized netlist of the memory controller into the top-level design.

  A memory controller can be debug enabled when added into the design from
  the Xilinx IP catalog. In the Vivado logic analyzer, or the Vivado Lab
  Edition, memory controllers implemented into a design are associated with
  hw_mig objects, one hw_mig object per debug-enabled memory controller. The
  hw_mig object will have all the properties needed to get the calibration
  status and draw the per-bit eye margin views.

  Implementation of the memory IP, and debug core, is automatic when you
  launch an implementation run using the launch_runs command, or when you run
  opt_design. However, you can also use the implement_mig_cores command to
  integrate the memory IP without having to implement the whole design.

  Note: All pins of the memory controller must be assigned prior to running
  the implement_mig_cores command, or an error will be returned. You can use
  report_drc to check the status of the memory controller.

  This command returns a transcript of its process, or returns an error if it
  fails.

Arguments:

  -outputdir <arg> - (Optional) Specify the output directory for the
  generated output products of the memory IP. If -outputdir is not specified,
  the output will be written to the current project folders.

  -rtlonly - (Optional) Generate only the PHY RTL information for the memory
  controller.

  -force - (Optional) Force the implementation of the memory IP even if it is
  up-to-date.

  -debug_output - (Optional) Enable the debugging feature of the memory IP.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example implements the memory IP cores in the current design:
