Description:

  Flush HDL signal information currently in memory into the specified Value
  Change Dump (VCD) file.

  VCD is an ASCII file containing header information, variable definitions,
  and the value change details of a set of HDL signals. The VCD file can be
  used to view simulation results in a VCD viewer, or to estimate the power
  consumption of the design.

  Note: You must run the open_vcd command to open a VCD file to write to
  before using the flush_vcd command.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example flushes the VCD buffer into the current VCD file:

    flush_vcd
