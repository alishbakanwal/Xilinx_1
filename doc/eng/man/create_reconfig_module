Description:

  Note: You must first define the project as a Partial Reconfiguration (PR)
  project by setting the PR_FLOW property on the project to TRUE, or by using
  the <uicontrol>Tools > Enable Partial Reconfiguration</uicontrol> command.

  The create_reconfig_module command defines an reconfigurable module (RM)
  from a specified hierarchical cell, or design file, and assigns it to the
  specified Partition Definition (partitionDef) in the current project.

  The Partial Reconfiguration flow allows RMs to be swapped into and out of a
  partitionDef to create a unique configuration of the design based on the
  combination of the core design and an RM. A single partitionDef can have
  multiple RMs to contain different netlists, constraints, or
  implementations. Each instance of the partitionDef in the design can be
  assigned a different RM to support many different configurations. The PR
  design flow requires the implementation of each PR configuration, resulting
  in partial bitstreams for the RMs, but complete bitstreams for each
  integrated configuration. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide:
  Partial Reconfiguration (UG909) for more information.

  This command returns the hierarchical name of the newly created RM, or
  returns an error if the command failed.

Arguments:

  -name <arg> - (Required) Specify a name for the reconfigurable module (RM)
  being created.

  -top <arg> - (Optional) Specify the top-level cell that defines the
  hierarchy of the RM. The cell can be specified by name.

  -gate_level - (Optional) Indicates that the RM is defined by a netlist file
  (EDIF or DCP) rather than by RTL source files.

  -partition_def <arg> - (Required) Specify the partitionDef object that the
  RM is assigned to. The partitionDef can be specified by name, or as an
  object as returned by the get_partition_defs command.

  -define_from <arg> - (Optional) Specify the hierarchical cell in the
  current project that the RM is defined from. The source files of the
  specified cell will define the source file contents of the RM. The cell can
  be specified by name.

  -define_from_file <arg> - (Optional) Specify the netlist or DCP file that
  defines the source for gate-level RM. If the path is not specified as part
  of the filename, the file will be looked for in the current working
  directory, or the directory that the Vivado tool was launched from.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The example below creates a reconfigurable module with the specified name:

    create_reconfig_module -name fftBottom -partition_def \ 
    [get_partition_defs partDef1 ] -top fftTop
