Description:

  Returns information related to clock nets in the design and clock resource
  utilization on the target device.

  The generated clock utilization report can generate placement constraints
  for the currently placed clock resources. You can use these constraints to
  preserve the placement of clock resources for future iterations of the
  design, by using the -write_xdc option.

  Note: For Ultrascale devices, if the intent is to recreate the current
  clock placement then use the BUFGCE LOC properties from the written XDC
  file. However, if the intent is to use the constraints as a starting point
  for the clocking architecture, while allowing the Vivado Design Suite some
  flexibility in placing clock resources, use the equivalent CLOCK_REGION
  properties instead of the BUFGCE LOC properties.

  By default the report is written to the Tcl console or STD output. However,
  the results can also be written to a file or returned as a string if
  desired.

  report_clock_utilization [-file <arg>] [-append] [-write_xdc <arg>]
  [-clock_roots_only] [-return_string] [-name <arg>] [-quiet] [-verbose]

Arguments:

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file. The
  specified file will be overwritten if one already exists.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -write_xdc <filename> - (Optional) Output XDC location constraints for the
  various clock resources to the specified filename. If the path is not
  specified as part of the file name the file will be created in the current
  working directory, or the directory from which the tool was launched.

  -clock_roots_only - (Optional) For UltraScale, and device architectures
  with clock roots, limit the report output to cover just the clock root
  assignments for each clock net.

  Note: This option is not supported for Xilinx 7 series devices.

  -return_string - (Optional) Direct the output to a Tcl string rather than
  to the standard output. The Tcl string can be captured by a variable
  definition and parsed or otherwise processed.

  -name <arg> - (Optional) The name of the Clock Utilization report view to
  display in the Vivado IDE when run in GUI mode. If the name has already
  been used in an open Report view, that view will be closed and a new report
  opened.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example returns information about the clock nets in the
  design and the clock resources utilized on the target device, and writes it
  to the specified file:

    report_clock_utilization -file C:/Data/FPGA_Design/clock_util.txt

  The following example reports the clock nets and clock resource utilization
  to the standard output, but writes the XDC location constraints to the
  specified file:

    report_clock_utilization -write_xdc clock_util_xdc.txt

  Note: Because the path is not specified as part of the XDC file name, the
  file will be created in the current working directory, or the directory
  from which the tool was launched.
