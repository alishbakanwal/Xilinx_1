Description:

  Returns a list of all output port objects that have been declared in the
  current design.

  To get a list of specific outputs in the design, use the get_ports command,
  or use the filter command to filter the results returned by all_outputs.

  The all_outputs command is scoped to return the objects hierarchically,
  from the top-level of the design or from the level of the current instance.
  By default the current instance is defined as the top level of the design,
  but can be changed by using the current_instance command.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example returns all the output ports in the current design:

    all_outputs

  The following example sets the output delay for all outputs in the design:

    set_output_delay 5 -clock REFCLK [all_outputs]
