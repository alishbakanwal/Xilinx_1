Description:

  Create a new port to add to an IP Integrator subsystem design. The port is
  a connection to signals external to the subsystem design.

  This command returns the name of the newly created port object, or returns
  an error message if it failed.

Arguments:

  -from <arg> - (Optional) The starting index of a standard bus port. This is
  unspecified for single bit ports.

  -to <arg> - (Optional) The ending index of a standard bus port. This is
  unspecified for single bit ports.

  -dir [ I | O | IO ] - (Required) The direction of the port. Valid values
  are I for input, O for output, and IO for bidirectional ports.

  -type <arg> - (Optional) Defines the type of the port as a clock port
  (CLK), a reset port (RST), a clock enable port (CE), an interrupt port
  (INTR), or as a data port (DATA). If you do not define the port type, it
  will be undefined (UNDEF).

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) The name of the subsystem port to create.

Examples:

  The following example creates a new bidirectional bus port in the current
  IP Integrator subsystem design:

    create_bd_port -from 0 -to 32 -dir IO -type data addr 
    /addr
