Description:

  Commit the current values of properties defined on the specified serial I/O
  hardware objects in the Hardware Manager feature of the Vivado Design Suite
  to the current hardware device.

  Specified objects can include any serial I/O object such as GTs, RXs, TXs,
  PLLs, or Commons, excluding hw_sio_scan and hw_sio_sweep objects. SIO
  objects also include device, target, or server hardware objects.

  The SIO IBERT core operates on an object property-based set/commit use
  model. You can set the property values on the hardware objects using the
  set_property command. You can then drive those values onto the current
  hardware device using the commit_hw_sio command.

  Note: To update the properties on the hardware object with the actual value
  on the device use the refresh_hw_sio command.

  This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_objects> - (Required) Specify one or more hw_sio objects to refresh.
  The hw_sio objects must be specified as objects returned by one of the
  get_hw_sio_* commands.

Example:

  The following example sets the value of the CPLL_REFCLK_DIV property on the
  specified serial I/O GT object, and then commits the values of all
  properties on that object to the current hardware device:

    set_property CPLL_REFCLK_DIV 3 [get_hw_sio_gts *MGT_X0Y8] 
    commit_hw_sio [list [get_hw_sio_gts *MGT_X0Y8}] ]
