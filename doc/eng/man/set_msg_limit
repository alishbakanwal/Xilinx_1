Description:

  Defines the number of messages that will be returned by the tool during a
  design session, or single invocation. You can specify the limit for a
  specific message ID, such as "Common 17-54", or specify a limit for all
  messages of a specific severity, such as "CRITICAL WARNING".

  Every message delivered by the tool has a unique global message ID that
  consists of an application sub-system code and a message identifier. This
  results in a message ID that looks like the following:

    "Common 17-54" 
    "Netlist 29-28" 
    "Synth 8-3295"

  You can report the current message limit of a message severity or ID with
  the get_msg_limit command. You can restore the default message limit using
  the reset_msg_limit command.

  If you do not specify either a message ID or a message severity as a
  qualifier for the set_msg_limit command, an error is returned.

  The default message limit for each message ID is defined by the parameter
  messaging.defaultLimit. This is the limit applied to each separate message
  returned by the tool. You can report the current value of this parameter
  with the get_param command, and change it as needed using the set_param
  command.

  You can change the severity of messages, limit the count of messages, and
  suppress messages altogether using the set_msg_config command.

Arguments:

  -id <value> - (Optional) The message ID, which is included in all returned
  messages. For example,"Common 17-54" and "Netlist 29-28".

  -severity <value> - (Optional) The severity of the message. There are five
  message severities:

   *  ERROR - An ERROR condition implies an issue has been encountered which
      will render design results unusable and cannot be resolved without user
      intervention.

   *  {CRITICAL WARNING} - A CRITICAL WARNING message indicates that certain
      input/constraints will either not be applied or are outside the best
      practices for a FPGA family. User action is strongly recommended.

      Note: Since this is a two word value, it must be enclosed in {}.

   *  WARNING - A WARNING message indicates that design results may be
      sub-optimal because constraints or specifications may not be applied as
      intended. User action may be taken or may be reserved.

   *  INFO - An INFO message is the same as a STATUS message, but includes a
      severity and message ID tag. An INFO message includes a message ID to
      allow further investigation through answer records if needed.

   *  STATUS - A STATUS message communicates general status of the process
      and feedback to the user regarding design processing. A STATUS message
      does not include a message ID.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  <count> - (Required) The message limit specified as a value >= 1. You can
  restore the message limit to the messaging.defaultLimit by specifying a
  count of -1.

Examples:

  The following example sets the message limit of the specified message ID:

    set_msg_limit -id "Netlist 29-28" 10000

  The following example sets the limit of the specified message severity:

    set_msg_limit -severity WARNING 50000

  The following example gets the current default message limit, specifies a
  new default value, then overrides the default for the specified message id:

    get_param messaging.defaultLimit 
       100 
    set_param messaging.defaultLimit 1000 
    set_msg_limit -id "common 17-81" 1500
