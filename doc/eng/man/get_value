Description:

  Get the value of a single HDL object at the current simulation run time.

  Note: Use the report_values command to return the values of more than one
  HDL objects.

  HDL objects include HDL signals, variables, or constants as defined in the
  Verilog or VHDL testbench and source files. An HDL signal includes Verilog
  wire or reg entities, and VHDL signals. Examples of HDL variables include
  Verilog real, realtime, time, and event.

  HDL constants include Verilog parameters and localparams, and VHDL generic
  and constants. The HDL scope, or scope, is defined by a declarative region
  in the HDL code such as a module, function, task, process, or begin-end
  blocks in Verilog. VHDL scopes include entity/architecture definitions,
  block, function, procedure, and process blocks.

Arguments:

  -radix <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the radix to use when returning the
  value of the specified object. Allowed values are: default, dec, bin, oct,
  hex, unsigned, and ascii.

  Note: The radix dec indicates a signed decimal. Specify the radix unsigned
  when dealing with unsigned data.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hdl_object> - (Required) Specifies a single HDL object to get the value
  of. The object can be specified by name, or can be returned as an object
  from the get_objects command.

Examples:

  The following example gets the value of the sysClk signal:

    get_value sysClk 
       Z

  This example shows the difference between the bin, dec, and unsigned radix
  on the value returned from the specified bus:

    get_value -radix bin /test/bench_VStatus_pad_0_i[7:0] 
       10100101 
    get_value -radix unsigned /test/bench_VStatus_pad_0_i[7:0] 
       165 
    get_value -radix dec /test/bench_VStatus_pad_0_i[7:0] 
       -91
