Description:

  Closes the open SAIF file.

  Only one SAIF file can be open in the Vivado simulator at one time, using
  open_saif. You must close the currently opened SAIF file before opening
  another file.

  This command returns nothing if it is successful, or an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following is an example:

    close_saif
