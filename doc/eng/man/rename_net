Description:

  Rename a net in the current synthesized or implemented design.

  The following are limitations with regard to renaming nets:

   *  You cannot rename nets that have DONT_TOUCH or MARK_DEBUG properties
      set to TRUE.

   *  You cannot rename individual bits of a bus net, but you can
      collectively rename the whole bus.

  Netlist editing changes the in-memory view of the netlist in the current
  design. It does not change the files in the source fileset, or change the
  persistent design on the disk. Changes made to the netlist may be saved to
  a design checkpoint using the write_checkpoint command, or may be exported
  to a netlist file such as Verilog, VHDL, or EDIF, using the appropriate
  write_* command.

  Note: Netlist editing is not allowed on the elaborated RTL design.

  Changes to the names of cells, nets, pins, and ports, will also affect the
  design constraints defined in the in-memory design. Constraints are
  automatically modified to target the new object name, however these are not
  written back to the source XDC file. Saving the modified in-memory design
  using write_checkpoint will save both the renamed objects and modified
  constraints.

  This command returns nothing if successful, or an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -to <arg> - (Required) Specify the new name to assign to the specified net.
  Specified names can not contain Tcl special characters: `"\{};$#

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <net> - (Required) Name of a net to rename.

Examples:

  The following example renames the specified bus signal:

    rename_net -to dataOut dout
