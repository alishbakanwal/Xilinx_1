Description:

  Reports the state of routing in the current design.

  The route status report can include a wide range of information, from a
  simple 1 if the design has routing, to a complete route tree for each net
  in the design.

Arguments:

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string rather than
  to the standard output. The Tcl string can be captured by a variable
  definition and parsed or otherwise processed.

  Note: This argument cannot be used with the -file option.

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file. The
  specified file will be overwritten if one already exists, unless -append is
  also specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -of_objects <args> - (Optional) Report the full routing tree for the
  specified route, net, or xdef_net objects.

  Note: The -of_objects option requires objects to be specified using the
  get_* commands, such as get_cells or get_pins, rather than specifying
  objects by name. In addition, -of_objects cannot be used with a search
  <pattern>.

  -route_type <arg> - (Optional) Only show routes with the specified route
  status. Valid route states are: UNPLACED, NOLOADS, NODRIVER, UNROUTED,
  ANTENNAS, CONFLICTS, PARTIAL, INTRASITE, HIERPORT, ROUTED.

  Note: This option is ignored if -of_objects is specified.

  -list_all_nets - (Optional) Report summary route status for every net in
  the design.

  Note: This option is ignored if -of_objects is specified.

  -show_all - (Optional) Report all relevant pins for routes marked as
  UNPLACED or PARTIAL routes and list all relevant nodes for routes marked as
  ANTENNAS or CONFLICTS routes. As a default only the first 15 pins or nodes
  are listed for a given route.

  -dump_routes - (Optional) Report the full routing tree for every routed net
  in the design.

  Note: This is a very long report, and can take some time to generate.

  -has_routing - (Optional) Returns false (0) if the design is unrouted, and
  returns true (1) if the design has routing. All other options are ignored
  when -has_routing is specified.

  Note: Has routing does not mean fully routed.

  -ignore_cache - (Optional) By default the report_route_status command is
  iterative, and only updates the route information for new nets and routes
  as the design is implemented. This argument will cause the command to
  ignore the cached information and regenerate the report for the entire
  design.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example reports the route status for the specified nets:

    report_route_status -of_objects [get_nets u4*]
