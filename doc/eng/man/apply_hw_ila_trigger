Description:

  Apply a trigger configuration file to the bitstream of a design, to support
  ILA trigger at startup.

  This command is used to configure the trigger settings of an ILA core in a
  design bitstream (.bit) file, so that the ILA debug core is armed to
  trigger on events immediately after device configuration and startup. This
  allows data to be captured from the earliest stages of device activity,
  which would not be possible through the use of the Hardware Manager feature
  of the Vivado Design Suite, and the run_hw_ila command.

  The apply_hw_ila_trigger command reads a trigger configuration file written
  by run_hw_ila -file and applies the various trigger settings to the ILA
  core in the implemented design. The trigger configuration for the ILA core
  then become part of the bitstream written by write_bitstream, that is used
  to program the Xilinx FPGA device.

  The process for using the trigger at startup feature includes the following
  steps:

   *  From the Hardware Manager, use run_hw_ila -file to export the trigger
      register map file for the ILA core.

   *  Open the implemented design, or the implemented design checkpoint.

   *  Use the apply_hw_ila_trigger command to apply the trigger settings to
      the in-memory design.

   *  Use the write_bitstream command to write the bitstream with the applied
      trigger configuration file.

      Note: Be sure to use the write_bitstream command, and not the Flow
      Navigator commands in the Vivado IDE.

   *  Return to the Hardware Manager, and use program_hw_device to program
      the hw_device using the new bitstream file.

  Once programmed, the new ILA core should immediately arm at startup. In the
  Vivado logic analyzer feature, you should see the "Trigger Capture Status"
  for the ILA core is now populated with captured data samples if trigger
  events or capture conditions have occurred. Refer to the Vivado Design
  Suite User Guide: Vivado Programming and Debugging (UG908) for more
  information.

Arguments:

  -ila_cell <arg> - (Optional) Apply trigger settings to the specified ILA
  cell. The cell must be specified as an object using the get_cells command.

  Note: The trigger configuration file includes the instance information for
  the ILA cell it applies to. The -ila_cell option is not required, and
  should only be used to apply the trigger file to a different ILA cell in
  the design.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - (Optional) Specify a trigger configuration file that was created
  by the run_hw_ila -file command.

Example:

  The following example applies the trigger configurations to the ILA cell
  instance that is defined in the specified file:

    apply_hw_ila_trigger C:/Data/ila1_triggers.tas
