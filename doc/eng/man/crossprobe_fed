Description:

  This command allows you to cross-probe from the tool to the Xilinx FPGA
  Editor that was opened with the launch_fpga_editor command. You can select
  both objects and timing paths to cross-probe between the editors.

Arguments:

  -run <name> - (Optional) The run name to use when cross-probing.

  -path <paths> - (Optional) One or more paths to cross-probe in the FPGA
  Editor.

  -objects <objects> - (Optional) One or more objects to cross-probe in the
  FPGA Editor. You can use any of the get_* commands, such as get_cells or
  get_ports, to select objects for cross-probing in the FPGA Editor. See the
  example below.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example defines a group of objects to be cross-probed in the
  FPGA Editor using the get_cells command to hierarchically locate primitive
  cells:

    crossprobe_fed -run impl_1 -objects [get_cells -hier -filter {IS_PRIMITIVE==1}]

  The following example identifies a path to be cross-probed in the FPGA
  Editor:

    crossprobe_fed -path {wbClk i_2090 wbClk_IBUF i_2089 n_0_2089 \ 
       egressLoop[4].egressFifo/buffer_fifo/infer_fifo.empty_reg_reg}
