Description:

  Writes a post-implementation hardware definition of the open design,
  including the generated bitstream, for use in the software development
  tools (SDK).

  The write_sysdef command, as well as the write_hwdef command, is intended
  to simplify the movement of designs from the Vivado Design Suite to
  software development in SDK. Both of these commands are run automatically
  by the Vivado Design Suite when generating the output products for a
  top-level design that includes a block design with an embedded processor
  like MicroBlaze, or Zynq-7000 All Programmable SoC. Block designs are
  created in the IP Integrator feature of the Vivado Design Suite with the
  create_bd_design command.

  The write_hwdef command runs after place_design, and the write_sysdef
  command runs after write_bitstream. The sysdef file includes all of the
  contents of the hardware definition file created by the write_hwdef
  command, with the addition of the bitstream (.bit) file and the memory map
  information (.mmi).

  The write_sysdef command returns nothing if successful, or an error if the
  command fails.

Arguments:

  -force - (Optional) Overwrite and existing system definition file if one
  exists. If this option is not specified, then the Vivado Design Suite will
  not overwrite an existing file.

  -hwdef <arg> - (Required) Specify the hardware definition file to include
  in the system definition file.

  -bitfile <arg> - (Required) Specify the bitstream file to include in the
  system definition file.

  -meminfo <arg> - (Optional) Specify the BRAM memory file to include in the
  system definition file. This file can be either the memory map information
  file (.mmi) written by the write_mem_info command, or the block memory map
  file created by write_bmm.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - (Required) Specify the name of the system definition file to
  write. The file can include the path and file extension. The default file
  extension of .sysdef is used if an extension is not specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example writes a system definition file from the specified
  hardware definition file, including the bitfile and the block memory map as
  specified:

    write_sysdef -hwdef "C:/Data/ug940/lab1/zynq_design.hwdef" \ 
       -bitfile "C:/ug940/lab1/zynq_debug/zynq_debug.runs/impl_1/zynq_design.bit" \ 
       -meminfo "C:/ug940/lab1/zynq_debug/zynq_debug.runs/impl_1/zynq_design.mmi" \ 
        C:/Data/ug940/lab1/zynq_design.sysdef
