Description:

  Closes the current open project.

  Note: Any user-defined Tcl variables that are in the global namespace (i.e.
  not in a project-specific namespace) are not reset or cleared by this
  command. Global variables are persistent with the invocation of Vivado and
  are only cleared when the Vivado Design Suite is closed. You can also use
  the unset command to expressly clear a specific Tcl variable.

Arguments:

  -delete - (Optional) Delete the project data from the hard disk after
  closing the project.

  Note: Use this argument with caution. You will not be prompted to confirm
  the deletion of project data.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following command closes the active project:

    close_project

  This example closes the current project. If you have multiple projects
  open, the close_project command applies to the current project which can be
  defined with the current_project command.

  The following example sets project_1 as the current project, and then
  closes the project and deletes it from the computer hard disk:

    current_project project_1 
    close_project -delete

  Note: Use the -delete argument with caution. You will not be prompted to
  confirm the deletion of project data.
