Description:

  Remove the current target data for the specified IP core. This deletes any
  files that were delivered during generation of the specified targets. This
  does not remove the core from the current project, but does remove the
  associated target data from its referenced location.

  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors

  trapped.

  all messages from this command.
