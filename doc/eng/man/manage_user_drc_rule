Description:

  Provides a utility to manage user-defined DRC rules.

  You can create user-defined DRCs by writing a DRC procedure, known as a Tcl
  checker, and registering the checking procedure as part of a DRC rule using
  the register_drc_rule command.

  The process in brief is:

   *  Write a Tcl checker procedure to define the method applied when
      checking the user-defined rule, and the objects to check against the
      rule.

   *  Use create_violation in the Tcl procedure to flag violations found when
      checking the rule against a design

   *  Register the Tcl checker as a user-defined DRC, and identify it with an
      abbreviation and category, using the register_drc_rule command.

   *  Enable or disable user-defined DRCs for use in a design with the
      manage_user_drc_rule command.

   *  Use the user-defined DRCs along with tool-defined DRCs when running the
      report_drc command.

  The manage_user_drc_rule command allows you to enable or disable previously
  registered rules for a specific DRC abbreviation. Enabled rules will be
  checked for violations when report_drc is run. Disabled rules will not be
  checked for violations.

  You can also use the -list_rules argument to list the currently registered
  rules available to enable or disable for the specified DRC abbreviation.

Arguments:

  -action [ register | unregister ] - (Optional) Select register to enable,
  or unregister to disable a user-defined DRC rule that has been previously
  registered using the register_drc_rule command. If this option is not
  specified, the rules will be disabled by default.

  -abbrev <arg> - The unique abbrev for the user-defined rule in the
  violation library. This should match the name of the rule specified in the
  register_drc_rule command.

  -rules <args> - (Optional) The list of rules to enable or disable. The
  -rules argument is used with the -action argument to specify the rules to
  enable or disable for the specified abbreviation. The specified rules must
  be associated with the abbreviation, or an error will be returned. Rules
  are associated with abbreviations using the register_drc_rule command.

  -list_rules [ all | enabled ] - (Optional) List the rules associated with
  the specified abbreviation. List all rules, or only those that are
  currently enabled. Use -list_rules in place of the -action and -rules
  arguments to list the rules currently registered with the specified DRC
  abbreviation.

  Note: -list_rules and -action cannot be used together. The command can
  either return a lits of rules to manage, or take the specified action on
  the specified rules.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example lists all rules currently registered with the
  specified abbreviation:

    manage_user_drc_rule -abbrev ABCD -list_rules all

  The following example disables both rule1 and rule2 for the specified
  abbreviation:

    manage_user_drc_rule -abbrev ABCD -action unregister -rules {rule1 rule2}

  The following example enables rule1 for the specified abbreviation:

    manage_user_drc_rule -abbrev ABCD -action register -rules {rule1}
