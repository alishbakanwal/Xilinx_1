Description:

  The report_objects command reports the type, name, and language of the
  specified HDL objects to the Tcl Console or Tcl shell. You must have an
  open simulation to use this command.

  This command returns a brief description of the specified objects. Use the
  describe command to return more detailed information.

  HDL objects include HDL signals, variables, or constants as defined in the
  Verilog or VHDL testbench and source files. An HDL signal includes Verilog
  wire or reg entities, and VHDL signals. Examples of HDL variables include
  Verilog real, realtime, time, and event. HDL constants include Verilog
  parameters and localparams, and VHDL generic and constants.

  The command returns the HDL object type, the name, and the code type
  (Verilog/VHDL) for each object, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hdl_objects> - (Optional) Specifies the objects to report. The default
  command reports all objects found in the current scope of the simulation,
  or current_scope.

  Note: Objects can be specified by name, or returned as objects by the
  get_objects command.

Examples:

  The following example shows how the specified objects reported depend upon
  the current scope of the simulation:

    current_scope testbench 
    /testbench 
    report_objects [get_objects leds_n] 
      Declared: {leds_n[3:0]}                  Verilog 
    current_scope dut 
    /testbench/dut 
    report_objects leds_n 
           Out: {LEDS_n[3:0]}                  VHDL

  This example reports the specified HDL objects of the current simulation
  scope:

    report_objects [get_objects GPIO*]
