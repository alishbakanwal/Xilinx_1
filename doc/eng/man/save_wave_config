Description:

  Save the current or specified wave configuration object to a specified
  filename.

  If the wave configuration object has not been saved before, and does not
  have a FILE_PATH property value, the <filename> is required and the NAME of
  the wave configuration object will be changed to match the specified
  <filename>.

  If the specified wave configuration object has been previously saved, and
  has a FILE_PATH property, the object will be written to its current
  location, and the <filename> does not need to be specified.

  If the wave configuration object has a FILE_PATH property, but a different
  <filename> is specified, the wave configuration object will be saved to the
  new <filename>, and the object will be renamed to match the specified
  <filename>.

Arguments:

  -object <arg> - (Optional) Specify a wave configuration object to save. If
  the wave configuration object has not been saved to a file before, you must
  also specify the <filename>. If -object is not specified, the current wave
  configuration object , as returned by current_wave_config is saved to the
  specified <filename>.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <filename> - (Optional) Specify a path and <filename> to save the current
  or specified wave configuration object. The <filename> should have a suffix
  of .wcfg, and the file suffix will be assigned automatically if no other
  suffix is supplied.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example saves the specified wave configuration object to a
  new filename:

    save_wave_config -object [get_wave_configs test.wcfg] \ 
    C:/Data/project/newTest

  Note: The wave config file will be assigned the .wcfg suffix since none is
  specified.
