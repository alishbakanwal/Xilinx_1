Description:

  This command is used in the Hierarchical Design Flows for Design
  Preservation and Partial Reconfiguration. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite
  User Guide: Hierarchical Design (UG905) for more information on these
  design flows, and the use of this command.

  The lock_design command is used to lock down the placement and/or routing
  of a design, or of the specified cell of a design. After reading in an
  Out-of-Context (OOC) design checkpoint using the read_checkpoint command,
  the preservation level for the module must be defined.

  This command sets the IS_LOC_FIXED, IS_BEL_FIXED, and IS_ROUTE_FIXED
  properties of the specified logic.

Arguments:

  -level <arg> - (Optional) Specify the level of the cell or design to
  preserve in the current design. As a default, the placement data is
  preserved. Accepted values are:

   *  logical - Preserves the logical design. Any placement or routing
      information is still used, but can be changed if the tools can achieve
      better results.

   *  placement - Preserves the logical and placed design. Any routing
      information is still used, but can be changed if the tools can achieve
      better results. This is the default setting.

   *  routing - Preserves the logical, placed and routed design. Internal
      routes are preserved, but interface nets are not. In order to preserve
      routing, the CONTAIN_ROUTING property must have been used on the Pblock
      during the OOC implementation. This ensures that there will be no
      routing conflicts when the OOC implementation is reused.

  -unlock - (Optional) Unlock cells. If cells are not specified, the whole
  design is unlocked. The -level parameter must be specified for unlocking.

  -export - (Optional) Permit the export the placement and routing data as an
  XDC file. The constraints of a locked design or cell can be exported using
  the write_xdc command. By default, the constraints of a locked design or
  cell cannot be exported.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <cell> - (Optional) Lock the specified cells in the design, if cells are
  not specified, the whole design is locked. The default is to lock all cells
  in the design.

  Note: Only placed cells and routed nets will be locked at the level
  specified.

Examples:

  The following example locks the placement and routing data for the
  specified cells of the current design:

    lock_design -level routing [get_cells usbEngine*]
