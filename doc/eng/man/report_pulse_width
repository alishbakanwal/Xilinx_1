Description:

  Reports the pulse width of the specified clock signals in the clock network
  and upon reaching the flip-flop. This command also performs high pulse
  width checking, using maximum delay for the rising edge and minimum delay
  for the falling edge of the clock. Performs low pulse width checking using
  minimum delay for the rising edge, and maximum delay for the falling edge.
  This results in a worst case analysis for the current Synthesis or
  Implemented Design because it assumes worst-case delays for both rising and
  falling edges. This command also reports the maximum skew, or maximum
  timing separation allowed between clock signals.

  The report includes minimum pulse width, maximum pulse width, low pulse
  width, high pulse width, and max skew checks by default. However, selecting
  a specific check will disable the other checks unless they are also
  specified.

  The default report is returned to the standard output, but can be
  redirected to a file, or to a Tcl string variable for further processing.
  The report is returned to the standard output by default, unless the -file,
  -return_string, or -name arguments are specified.

Arguments:

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file. If the
  specified file already exists, it will be overwritten by the new report,
  unless the -append option is also specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -name <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the name of the results set for the GUI.
  Pulse Width reports in the GUI can be deleted by the delete_timing_results
  command.

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string rather than
  to the standard output. The Tcl string can be captured by a variable
  definition and parsed or otherwise processed.

  Note: This argument cannot be used with the -file option.

  -warn_on_violation - (Optional) Specify that a Critical Warning will be
  generated by the Vivado Design Suite when the report contains a violation.

  -all_violators - (Optional) Report only the <objects> where violations are
  found.

  -significant_digits <arg> - (Optional) The number of significant digits in
  the output results. The valid range is 0 to 3. The default setting is 2
  significant digits.

  -limit <arg> - (Optional) The number of checks of a particular type to
  report per clock. This is a value >= 1, and the default is 1.

  -min_period - (Optional) Report minimum period checks.

  -max_period - (Optional) Report maximum period checks.

  -low_pulse - (Optional) Report minimum low pulse width checks.

  -high_pulse - (Optional) Report minimum high pulse width checks.

  -max_skew - (Optional) Check the skew constraints between two clock pins.

  Note: The default of the report_pulse_width command is to report
  min_period, max_period, low_pulse,high_pulse, and max_skew. Specifying one
  or more of these options configures the command to only report the
  specified checks.

  -clocks <arg> - (Optional) Clocks to report pulse width and period checks.
  All clocks are checked if the -clocks option is not specified.

  -no_header - (Optional) Eliminate the report header from the results. This
  can be especially useful when returning the results as a string with
  -return_string.

  -rpx <arg> - (Optional) Specify the file name and path of an Xilinx report
  file (RPX) to write. This is different from writing the report results to a
  file using the -file argument. The RPX file is an interactive report that
  contains all the report information and can be reloaded into memory in the
  Vivado Design Suite using the open_report command. You should add a .rpx
  file extension to the specified file name, as the Vivado tool will not
  automatically assign a file extension.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - (Optional) The pin objects to report the pulse width from. All
  pins are checked if no <objects> are specified.

Examples:

  The following example performs the minimum period and low pulse width
  check, returning the results to a named results set in the GUI:

    report_pulse_width -min_period -low_pulse -name timing_1
