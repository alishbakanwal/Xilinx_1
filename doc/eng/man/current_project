Description:

  Specifies the current project or returns the current project when no
  project is specified.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <project> - (Optional) The name of the project to make current. This
  command can be used prior to the close_project to make a specific project
  active and then to close the project.

Examples:

  The following example sets project_2 as the current project:

    current_project project_2

  This command makes the current project the focus of all the tool commands.
  In the GUI mode, the current project is defined automatically when
  switching the GUI between projects.

  The following example returns the name of the current project in the tool:

    current_project

  Note: The returned value is the name of the project and not the name or
  path of the project file.
