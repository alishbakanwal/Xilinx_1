Description:

  Specifies the external system-level path delay on a primary input port
  relative to a clock edge at the interface of the design. The input delay
  value is specified in nanoseconds (ns), and can be positive or negative,
  depending on the clock and data relative phase at the interface of the
  device.

  To accurately model the system-level timing of your Xilinx FPGA design, you
  must assign timing delays for objects external to the FPGA onto the primary
  input or output ports in your design. These delays are defined by the
  set_input_delay and set_output_delay commands.

  Note: If the input port also has a set_max_delay constraint assigned, the
  specified input delay value is considered part of the max_delay
  computation. That is, the input delay consumes a portion of the max delay
  on the timing path that includes the input port.

  This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -clock <arg> - (Optional) Indicates that the input delay is relative to the
  specified clock. By default the rising edge is used. However the
  -clock_fall argument can be used to indicate that the falling edge should
  be used instead.

  -reference_pin <arg> - (Optional) Specifies that the delay is relative to
  the active edge of a clock appearing on the specified pin or port rather
  than a clock.

  -clock_fall - (Optional) Specifies that the delay is relative to a falling
  edge of the clock rather than rising edge.

  -rise - (Optional) Specifies the input delay applies to rising transitions
  on the specified ports. The default is to apply the delay for both rising
  and falling transitions.

  -fall - (Optional) Specifies the input delay applied to falling transitions
  on the specified ports. The default is to apply the delay for both rising
  and falling transitions.

  -max - (Optional) Indicates the input delay specified is only used when
  calculating the maximum (longest) path delays.

  -min - (Optional) Indicates the input delay specified is only used when
  calculating the minimum (shortest) path delays.

  -add_delay - (Optional) Add the specified delay to any existing delay on
  the port. The default behavior is to replace the existing delays.

  -network_latency_included - (Optional) Indicates that the clock network
  latency of the reference clock is included in the delay value. The Vivado
  timing engine considers the clock edge reaching the capture flop after the
  clock latencies unless the specified input or output delay value includes
  the source latency or network latency.

  -source_latency_included - (Optional) Indicates that the source latency of
  the relative clock is included in the specified delay value.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <delay> - (Required) The input delay specified as nanoseconds (ns) to apply
  to the specified ports. Valid values are floating point numbers, with a
  default value of 0.

  <objects> - (Required) The list of ports to which the delay value will be
  assigned.

Examples:

  The following example specifies the input delay on port DIN. The input
  delay is 3 and is relative to the rising edge of clock clk1:

    set_input_delay -clock clk1 3 DIN

  The following example specifies the input delay on port DIN. The input
  delay is 2 and is relative to the falling edge of the clock clk1:

    set_input_delay -clock_fall -clock clk1 2 DIN

  The following example specifies the input delay on port reset. The input
  delay is 2 and is relative to the rising edge of the clock that appears on
  the pin wbClk_IBUF_BUFG_inst/O, originating from the clock wbClk:

    set_input_delay -clock wbClk 2 -reference_pin \ 
       [get_pin wbClk_IBUF_BUFG_inst/O] reset

  The following example specifies the input delay on all non clock input
  ports of the design. Although all_inputs returns all ports of the design,
  including clock ports, set_input_delay will skip setting input delays on
  the clock ports. The input delay is 1 relative to the rising edge of the
  clock wbClk:

    set_input_delay -clock wbClk 1 [all_inputs]

  The following example sets an input delay of 4 relative to the rising edge
  of the clock wbClk on the ports reset and wbDataForInput:

    
    set_input_delay -clock wbClk 4 [list reset wbDataForInput]
