Description:

  Refreshes the in-memory view of all of the properties, or specified
  properties, of the specified hw_sio objects with values read from the
  actual object on the hardware device.

  Specified objects can include any serial I/O object such as GTs, RXs, TXs,
  PLLs, or Commons, excluding hw_sio_scan and hw_sio_sweep objects. SIO
  objects also include device, target, or server hardware objects.

  The refresh_hw_sio command reads the values of the specified objects on the
  hardware device, and applies the value to the associated property of the
  IBERT core in the Hardware Manager.

  This command returns no feedback of its operation if successful, or returns
  an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -regexp - (Optional) The list of properties to refresh is defined using
  regular expression.

  -properties <args> - (Optional) Refresh the specified property or
  properties of the hw_sio objects. As a default behavior, if no properties
  are specified, all properties of the specified object or objects will be
  refreshed from the current values on the hardware device.

  Note: If a non-existent property is specified, that property is ignored.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_objects> - (Required) Specify one or more hw_sio objects to refresh.
  The hw_sio objects must be specified as objects returned by on of the
  get_hw_sio_* commands.

Example:

  The following example refreshes all properties on the specified hw_sio_gt
  object:

    refresh_hw_sio [get_hw_sio_gts *MGT_X0Y11]

  The following example refreshes all of the properties on all of the hw_sio
  objects on the current hardware device:

    refresh_hw_sio [current_hw_device]
