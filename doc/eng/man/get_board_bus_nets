Description:

  Gets a list of individual connection bus nets of the specified connection
  bus object, or the board component or board component pin objects.

  The board file, board.xml located in the data/boards folder of the Vivado
  Design Suite installation area, stores information regarding board
  attributes. The board provides a representation of the overall system that
  the Xilinx device is a part of, and can help define key aspects of the
  design, such as clock constraints, I/O port assignments, and supported
  interfaces. You can create custom boards by defining a custom Board
  Interface file, as described in the Vivado Design Suite User Guide:
  System-Level Design Entry (UG895).

  Connection buses define the connections between the Xilinx device (part0)
  and other components on the board. Bus nets define individual connections
  of the connection bus.

  This command returns a list of connection bus nets, or returns an error if
  it fails.

Arguments:

  -regexp - (Optional) Specifies that the search <patterns> are written as
  regular expressions. Both search <patterns> and -filter expressions must be
  written as regular expressions when this argument is used. Xilinx regular
  expression Tcl commands are always anchored to the start of the search
  string. You can add ".*" to the beginning or end of a search string to
  widen the search to include a substring. See
  http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html for help with regular expression
  syntax.

  Note: The Tcl built-in command regexp is not anchored, and works as a
  standard Tcl command. For more information refer to
  http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/regexp.htm.

  -nocase - (Optional) Perform case-insensitive matching when a pattern has
  been specified. This argument applies to the use of -regexp only.

  -all - (Optional) Return a list of all connection bus nets defined in Board
  Interface file of the specified object.

  -filter - (Optional) Filter the results list with the specified expression.
  The -filter argument filters the list of objects returned by
  get_board_bus_nets based on property values on the bus nets. You can find
  the properties on an object with the report_property or list_property
  commands. Any property/value pair can be used as a filter. In the case of
  the board bus net object, "BUS", "NAME", and "DELAY" are some of the
  properties that can be used to filter results.

  The filter search pattern should be quoted to avoid having to escape
  special characters that may be found in net, pin, or cell names, or other
  properties. String matching is case-sensitive and is always anchored to the
  start and to the end of the search string. The wildcard "*" character can
  be used at the beginning or at the end of a search string to widen the
  search to include a substring of the property value.

  Note: The filter returns an object if a specified property exists on the
  object, and the specified pattern matches the property value on the object.
  In the case of the "*" wildcard character, this will match a property with
  a defined value of "".

  For string comparison, the specific operators that can be used in filter
  expressions are "equal" (==), "not-equal" (!=), "match" (=~), and
  "not-match" (!~). Numeric comparison operators <, >, <=, and >= can also be
  used. Multiple filter expressions can be joined by AND and OR (&& and ||).
  The following gets input pins that do NOT contain the "RESET" substring
  within their name:

    get_pins * -filter {DIRECTION == IN && NAME !~ "*RESET*"}

  Boolean (bool) type properties can be directly evaluated in filter
  expressions as true or not true:

    -filter {IS_PRIMITIVE && !IS_LOC_FIXED}

  -of_objects <args> - (Required) Get the nets of connection buses of the
  specified board_bus, board_component, or board_component_pin objects.

  Note: The -of_objects option requires objects to be specified using the
  get_* commands, such as get_cells or get_pins, rather than specifying
  objects by name. In addition, -of_objects cannot be used with a search
  <pattern>.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <patterns> - (Optional) Match board bus nets against the specified search
  patterns. The default pattern is the wildcard `*` which gets a list of all
  connection bus nets of the specified objects.

Examples:

  The following example gets the connection bus nets associated with the
  specified component of the current board:

    get_board_bus_nets -of_objects [get_board_components {*iic_main*}]
