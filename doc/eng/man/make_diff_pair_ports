Description:

  Joins two existing ports to create a differential pair. The port
  directions, interfaces, and other properties must match in order for the
  specified ports to be joined as a differential pair. Otherwise an error
  will be returned.

  Note: The two ports must first be created, either by using the create_port
  command or by reading in an XDC file, prior to making them into a
  differential pair.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <ports> - (Required) Two port objects to join as a differential pair. The
  first port specified will be the positive side of the differential pair.

Examples:

  The following example joins the two specified ports to create a
  differential pair:

    make_diff_pair_ports port_Pos1 port_Neg1
