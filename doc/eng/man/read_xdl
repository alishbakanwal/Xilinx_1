Description:

  Import ISE placement results using XDL format data. XDL data is created
  automatically when implementation runs are launched. You can also create an
  XDL format file from an NCD file using the XDL command-line tool.

  You can create XDL files and import placement for the entire design, for
  individual modules, or relative to specific Pblocks.

Arguments:

  -pblock <arg> - (Optional) The name of a Pblock in the current design. The
  data in the XDL file will be imported relative to the specified block.

  -cell <arg> - (Optional) The name of a hierarchical cell in the current
  design to import the XDL file into. The data in the XDL file will be
  imported relative to the specified cell.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - The file name of the XDL file to be imported.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the tool will
  search for the specified file in the current working directory and then in
  the directory from which the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example reads the specified XDL file into the top-level of
  the design:

    
    read_xdl C:/Data/FPGA_Designs/bft.xdl
