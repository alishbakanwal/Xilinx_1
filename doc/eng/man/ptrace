Description:

  Enables process tracing for simulation debugging purposes.

  During simulation the name of the HDL process that is evaluated will be
  written to the Tcl console, as well as the simulation source file and line
  number associated with the process.

  Note: Process tracing provides more detailed information than is available
  with line tracing and the ltrace command.

  This feature can also be enabled using the PROCESS_TRACING property on the
  current simulation object:

    set_property PROCESS_TRACING on [current_sim]

  The command returns the state of process tracing, or returns an error if it
  fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <value> - (Required) Enables or disables process tracing during simulation.
  Specify a <value> of true to enable process tracing, or false to disable
  it.

Example:

  The following example enables process tracing:

    ptrace true
