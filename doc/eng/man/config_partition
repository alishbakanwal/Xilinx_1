Description:

  Configure a partition prior to synthesis or implementation.

  Specify the partition module as a cell or as the top module, the action to
  take for the specific module, the path to import partition data from, and
  the level of partition data to preserve.

Arguments:

  -cell - (Optional) Specify the cell name of the partition to configure.

  Note: If this option is not specified, the config_partition command applies
  to the top partition in the design.

  -reconfig_module <name> - (Optional) The Reconfigurable Module variant to
  configure.

  -import - (Optional) Import data for the specified partition from the
  -import_dir during synthesis or implementation to preserve prior results.

  -implement -(Optional) Discard prior results and reimplement the specified
  partition during synthesis or implementation. This treats the partition
  like any other hierarchical module in the design.

  Note: -implement and -import are mutually exclusive arguments.

  -import_dir <name> - (Optional) The directory to import partition data from.

  Note: If the path to the directory is not specified, the tool will look in
  your home directory for the partition data:

   *  For Windows: %APPDATA%/Xilinx/PlanAhead

   *  For Linux: $HOME/.Xilinx/PlanAhead

  -preservation <level> - (Optional) The preservation level for the imported
  partitions. Valid values are routing, placement, and synthesis. The default
  is to preserve routing.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <run> - - The run to be configured.

Examples:

  The following example creates a partition on the module sub_block_inst and
  configures the partition to be implemented during impl_1 run:

    config_partition -run synth_1 -cell usbEngine0 -import -import_dir \ 
    C:/Data/DP_RTL/synth1 -preservation placement
