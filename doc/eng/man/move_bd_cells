Description:

  Move IP Integrator cells into the specified hierarchical module within the
  current subsystem design. The connections between the cells being moved are
  maintained; connections between these cells and other cells that are not
  being moved are maintained automatically by IP Integrator adding pins and
  ports to cross the hierarchical boundary.

  Cells in the IP subsystem design can also be copied into a hierarchical
  module using copy_bd_objs, and can be grouped and added to a hierarchical
  module using group_bd_objs.

  This command returns the name of the <parent_cell> module when successful,
  or returns an error message if it failed.

Arguments:

  -prefix <arg> - (Optional) A prefix name to apply to any cells that are
  moved into the hierarchical module.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <parent_cell> - The name of the hierarchical module to move cells into.

  <cells> - (Optional) The list of cells, specified by the get_bd_cells
  command, to move from the current IP subsystem design into the hierarchical
  module.

Example:

  The following example :

    move_bd_cells -prefix mod1_ /myModule1 [get_bd_cells /myAxiFifo_1] 
    /myModule1
