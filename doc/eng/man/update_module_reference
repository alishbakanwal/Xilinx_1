Description:

  Refresh the block design cell or cells that reference module definitions
  from RTL source files by rereading the module definition from the source
  file.

  Note: This command does not cause the Vivado tool to reread the source
  file. If changes have been made to the source file it must be separately
  updated.

  This command returns a transcript of the update process as well as any
  warnings related to design changes, or returns nothing if the command
  fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <ips> - (Optional) Specifies the module references in the current design to
  upgrade. Modules can be specified by name, or returned by the get_ips
  command.

Examples:

  The following example updates the specified module references in the
  current design:

    update_module_reference {rtlRam_0 uart_0}
