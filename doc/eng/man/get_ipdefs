Description:

  Get a list of IP cores defined in the IP catalog of the current project,
  based on the specified search pattern. The default is to return all IP
  cores defined in the catalog.

  By default, the search is based on the VLNV property of the IP cores in the
  catalog. You can specify the -name option to search on the display name of
  IP cores instead.

  get_ipdefs [-name] [-regexp] [-nocase] [-filter <arg>] [-of_objects <args>]
  [-quiet] [-verbose] [<patterns>...]

Arguments:

  -name - (Optional) Indicates that the specified <pattern> refers to the
  DISPLAY_NAME property of the IP instead of the VLNV property.

  Note: In the case of multi-word display names, such as "Multiply Adder",
  you can only search for a single string, so you would need to search for
  *Multiply* or *Adder* to locate this IP core.

  -regexp - (Optional) Specifies that the search <patterns> are written as
  regular expressions. Both search <patterns> and -filter expressions must be
  written as regular expressions when this argument is used. Xilinx regular
  expression Tcl commands are always anchored to the start of the search
  string. You can add ".*" to the beginning or end of a search string to
  widen the search to include a substring. See
  http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html for help with regular expression
  syntax.

  Note: The Tcl built-in command regexp is not anchored, and works as a
  standard Tcl command. For more information refer to
  http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/regexp.htm.

  -nocase - (Optional) Perform case-insensitive matching when a pattern has
  been specified. This argument applies to the use of -regexp only.

  -filter <args> - Filter the results list with the specified expression. The
  -filter argument filters the list of objects returned by get_ipdefs based
  on property values on the objects. You can find the properties on an object
  with the report_property or list_property commands. In the case of the
  "ipdefs" object, "VLNV", "NAME" and "IS_AXI" are some of the properties
  that can be used to filter results.

  The filter search pattern should be quoted to avoid having to escape
  special characters that may be found in net, pin, or cell names, or other
  properties. String matching is case-sensitive and is always anchored to the
  start and to the end of the search string. The wildcard "*" character can
  be used at the beginning or at the end of a search string to widen the
  search to include a substring of the property value.

  Note: The filter returns an object if a specified property exists on the
  object, and the specified pattern matches the property value on the object.
  In the case of the "*" wildcard character, this will match a property with
  a defined value of "".

  For string comparison, the specific operators that can be used in filter
  expressions are "equal" (==), "not-equal" (!=), "match" (=~), and
  "not-match" (!~). Numeric comparison operators <, >, <=, and >= can also be
  used. Multiple filter expressions can be joined by AND and OR (&& and ||).
  The following gets input pins that do NOT contain the "RESET" substring
  within their name:

    get_pins * -filter {DIRECTION == IN && NAME !~ "*RESET*"}

  Boolean (bool) type properties can be directly evaluated in filter
  expressions as true or not true:

    -filter {IS_PRIMITIVE && !IS_LOC_FIXED}

  -of_objects <args> - (Optional) Get the IP definitions for the specified IP
  instances or IP file (.xci) objects. Objects must be specified by the
  get_ips or get_files command.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <patterns> - (Optional) Match IP core definitions in the IP catalog against
  the specified search patterns. The default pattern is the wildcard `*`
  which gets a list of all IP cores in the catalog. More than one pattern can
  be specified to find multiple core definitions based on different search
  criteria.

  Note: You must enclose multiple search patterns in braces, {}, or quotes,
  "", to present the list as a single element.

Examples:

  The following example returns a list of all IP cores with NAME property
  matching the specified pattern:

    get_ipdefs -filter {NAME=~*agilent*}

  Note: The filter operator `=~` loosely matches the specified pattern.

  The following example returns a list of all AXI compliant IP cores:

    get_ipdefs -filter {IS_AXI==1}
