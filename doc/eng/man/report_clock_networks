Description:

  Reports the network fanout of each clock net in the open synthesized or
  implemented design. The graphical form of the report, returned when the
  -name argument is specified, provides a hierarchical tree view of the clock
  network.

  The default report simply specifies the clock net names and the instance
  pins that are the startpoint of the clock.

  The report is returned to the standard output unless the -file,
  -return_string, or -name arguments are specified.

Arguments:

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the clock network report into the specified
  file. The specified file will be overwritten if one already exists, unless
  -append is also specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -name <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the name of the results to output to the
  GUI.

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string. The Tcl
  string can be captured by a variable definition and parsed or otherwise
  processed.

  Note: This argument cannot be used with the -file option.

  -endpoints_only - (Optional) Report the clock network endpoints; bucketed
  by cell type, and sorted by clock pins and non-clock pins. This option
  cannot be specified with the -levels option.

  -levels <arg> - (Optional) Expands the clock network through the specified
  levels of instances. The default value is 0. The specified value can be
  greater than 0. This reports the clock path to the path endpoints if enough
  levels are specified. Path endpoints are bucketed by cell type, and sorted
  by clock pins and non-clock pins. This option cannot be used with the
  -endpoints_only option.

  -expand_buckets - (Optional) Expand the clock network report to expand all
  of the endpoints buckets returned by the -endpoints_only or -levels
  options, to report all of the clock endpoints.

  -suppress_endpoints [ clock | nonclock ] - (Optional) Suppress reported
  paths from clock root to clock pins or non-clock endpoint pins. This option
  eliminates either clock or non-clock pins from the clock network report.

  -clocks <args> - (Optional) Specify the clock objects to include in the
  clock network report. When not specified, the report includes all clocks.

  -unconstrained_roots <args> - (Optional) For UltraScale devices, and device
  architectures with clock roots, specify the list of unconstrained clock
  root pins or ports to include in the clock network report. If this option
  is not specified, all unconstrained clock roots are reported.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example reports the clock network names and startpoints to
  the specified file:

    report_clock_networks -file C:/Data/ClkNets.txt

  The following example reports the endpoints of the specified clock:

    report_clock_networks -endpoints_only -clocks wbClk
