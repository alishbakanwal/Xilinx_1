BD_INTF_NET

Description: 
An interface is a grouping of signals that share a common function, containing 
both individual signals and multiple buses. An AXI4-Lite master, for example, 
contains a large number of individual signals plus multiple buses, which are all 
required to make a connection. By grouping these signals and buses into an 
interface, the Vivado IP integrator can identify common interfaces and 
automatically make multiple connections in a single step. 

An interface is defined using the IP-XACT standard. Standard interfaces provided 
by Xilinx can be found in the Vivado installation directory at data/ip/interfaces. 
See the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Designing IP Subsystems Using IP Integrator
(UG994) for more information on interface nets, pins, and ports. 

A block design interface net, or a bd_intf_net object, connects the interface pins 
on a block design cell to other interface pins, or to external interface ports. 
The bd_intf_net object connects through multiple levels of the design hierarchy, 
connecting block design cells. Every interface net has a name which identifies it 
in the design. All block design cells, interface pins, and interface ports connected 
to these nets are electrically connected.

Related Objects:
The block design interface net, bd_intf_net object, occurs in a block design, or 
diagram. It is connected to interface ports (bd_intf_port), and through interface 
pins (bd_intf_pin) to block design cells (bd_cell) in the diagram. You can query the 
bd_intf_nets of the diagram, bd_cell, bd_intf_pin, and bd_intf_port objects. 

	get_bd_intf_nets -of_objects [get_bd_intf_ports]

In addition, you can query the bd_cells, or the bd_intf_pins, or bd_intf_port objects 
that are connected to a specific bd_intf_net:

	get_bd_cells -of_objects [get_bd_intf_nets /INTERRUPT_1_1]

Properties:
The properties on the bd_intf_net object include the following, including example values:

Property  Type    Read-only  Visible  Value
CLASS     string  true       true     bd_intf_net
NAME      string  false      true     microblaze_0_axi_periph_to_s00_couplers
PATH      string  true       true     /microblaze_0_axi_periph/microblaze_0_axi_periph_to_s00_couplers

To report the properties for the bd_intf_net object, you can copy and paste the 
following command into the Vivado Design Suite Tcl shell or Tcl console:

	report_property -all [lindex [get_bd_intf_nets] 0]
