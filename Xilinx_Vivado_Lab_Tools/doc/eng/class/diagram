DIAGRAM

Description: 
A block dsign (.bd) is a complex system of interconnected IP cores created in 
the IP Integrator feature of the Vivado Design Suite. The Vivado IP integrator 
feature lets you create complex system designs by instantiating and interconnecting 
IP from the Vivado IP catalog. A block design is a hierarchical design which can 
be written to a file (.bd) on disk, but is stored as a diagram object within the 
Vivado tool memory. Designs are typically constructed at the interface level for 
increased productivity, but may also be edited at the port or pin level, to provide
greater control. A Vivado project may incorporate multiple diagrams, at different 
levels of the design hierarchy, or may consist of a single diagram as the top-level 
design. 

Related Objects:
Diagrams are top-level objects, which contain other block design objects such as 
bd_cells, and bd_nets. You can query the block_design objects of a diagram 
(get_bd_addr_spaces -of_objects [get_bd_designs]), but you cannot query diagrams 
in relation to other objects. 

Properties:
The following table lists the properties assigned to a diagram object in the 
Vivado Design Suite, with example values:

Property           Type    Read-only  Visible  Value
CLASS              string  true       true     diagram
COLOR              string  false      true     
FILE_NAME          string  true       true     design_1.bd
NAME               string  true       true     design_1
USE_IP_SHARED_DIR  bool    false      true     1

To report the properties for a diagram object, you can copy and paste the 
following command into the Vivado Design Suite Tcl shell or Tcl console:

     report_property -all [get_bd_designs]

or, when there are multiple block designs in the Vivado Design Suite:

	report_property -all [lindex [get_bd_designs] 0]
