HW_SERVER

Description: 

The hardware server manages connections to a hardware target, for instance a 
hardware board containing a JTAG chain of one or more Xilinx FPGA devices to be 
used for programming and debugging your FPGA design.

When you open the Hardware Manager with the open_hw command, you can connect to a 
hardware server, either locally or remotely, using the connect_hw_server command. 
This launches the hw_server application, and creates a hw_server object. 

Related Objects:
Hardware servers are apex objects in the Hardware Manager, managing connections to 
hardware targets. You can query the objects related to the hw_server:

	get_hw_targets -of [get_hw_servers] 

Properties:
You can use the report_property command to report the properties assigned to a 
hw_server object. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite Tcl Command Reference (UG835) 
for more information. The properties assigned to the hw_target object include the 
following, with example values:

Property  Type    Read-only  Visible  Value
CLASS     string  true       true     hw_server
HOST      string  true       true     localhost
NAME      string  true       true     localhost
PASSWORD  string  true       true     
PORT      string  true       true     60001
SID       string  true       true     TCP:xcoatslab-1:3121
VERSION   string  true       true     20

To report the properties for a hw_target, you can copy and paste the following command 
into the Vivado Design Suite Tcl shell or Tcl console:

	report_property -all [get_hw_servers]
