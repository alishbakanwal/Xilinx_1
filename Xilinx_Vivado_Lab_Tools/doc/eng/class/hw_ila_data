HW_ILA_DATA

Description: 
The hardware ILA data object is a repository for data captured on the ILA debug 
core programmed onto the current hardware device. The upload_hw_ila_data command 
creates a hw_ila_data object in the process of moving the captured data from the 
ILA debug core, hw_ila, on the physical FPGA device, hw_device. 

The read_hw_ila_data command can also create a hw_ila_data object when reading an 
ILA data file from disk. 

The  hw_ila_data object can be viewed in the waveform viewer of the Vivado logic 
analyzer by using the display_hw_ila_data command, and can be written to disk 
using the write_hw_ila_data command.

Related Objects:
Hardware ILA data objects are associated with the ILA debug cores programmed on 
the hardware device. You can query the data objects as follows:

	get_hw_ila_datas -of_objects [get_hw_ilas]

Properties:
You can use the report_property command to report the properties assigned to a 
hw_ila_data object. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite Tcl Command Reference (UG835) 
for more information. The properties are as follows:

Property   Type    Read-only  Visible  Value
CLASS      string  true       true     hw_ila_data
HW_ILA     string  true       true     hw_ila_1
NAME       string  true       true     hw_ila_data_1
TIMESTAMP  string  true       true     Sat Mar 08 11:05:49 2014

To report the properties for the hw_ila_data object, you can copy and paste the 
following command into the Vivado Design Suite Tcl shell or Tcl console:

	report_property  -all [lindex [get_hw_ila_datas] 0]
