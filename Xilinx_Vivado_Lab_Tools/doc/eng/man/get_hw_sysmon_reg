Description:

  Returns the hex value of the system monitor register defined at the
  specified address of the specified hw_sysmon object.

  The System Monitor (SYSMON) Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) is used to
  measure die temperature and voltage on the hw_device. The sysmon monitors
  the physical environment via on-chip temperature and supply sensors. The
  ADC can access up to 17 external analog input channels.

  Data for the system monitor is stored in dedicated registers, called status
  and control registers, accessible through the hw_sysmon_reg object. Refer
  to the Register Interface in UltraScale Architecture System Monitor User
  Guide (UG580), or 7 Series FPGAs and Zynq-7000 All Programmable SoC XADC
  Dual 12-Bit 1 MSPS Analog-to-Digital Converter User Guide (UG480) for more
  information on the addresses of specific system monitor registers.

  Although the get_hw_sysmon_reg command lets you directly access the values
  stored in registers of the hw_sysmon object, the recommended procedure is
  to retrieve the values of registers as formatted properties of the
  hw_sysmon object. For example, the following code retrieves the TEMPERATURE
  on the system monitor as a formatted property of the hw_sysmon object
  rather than accessing the hex value of the sysmon register:

    set opTemp [get_property TEMPERATURE [get_hw_sysmons]

  The get_property command returns the TEMPERATURE as a formatted value in
  degrees Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin as determined by the
  TEMPERATURE_SCALE property on the hw_sysmon object.

  Note: You can also be sure the property value on the object is current by
  issuing the refresh_hw_sysmon command prior to get_property.

  The get_hw_sysmon_reg command returns the unformatted hex value of the
  hw_sysmon_reg object on the specified hw_sysmons at the specified address,
  or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_sysmon> - (Required) Specify the hw_sysmon object to access the
  registers of. The hw_sysmon must be specified as an object as returned by
  the get_hw_sysmons command.

  <hexaddress> - (Required) Specify the hex address of the register on the
  system monitor to return the value of. The address is specified as a hex
  value, and the value at the specified address is returned as a hex value.

Example:

  The following example gets the value of the hw_sysmon_reg at the specified
  address, 00, which relates to the XADC register storing the operating
  temperature of the current hw_device:

    set opTemp [get_hw_sysmon_reg [lindex [get_hw_sysmons] 0 ] 00 ]

  Note: The operating temperature is returned as a hex value.
