Description:

  Returns a list of all flip flop instances in the current design.

  You can use the get_cells command, or use the filter command to limit the
  results from the all_ffs command to return a list of flip-flop cells
  matching the specified properties.

  The all_ffs command is scoped to return the objects hierarchically, from
  the top-level of the design or from the level of the current instance. By
  default the current instance is defined as the top level of the design, but
  can be changed by using the current_instance command.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example returns the count of all flops in the design, then
  returns the count of all flops in the fftEngine module:

    current_instance 
    INFO: [Vivado 12-618] Current instance is the top level of design `netlist_1`. 
    top 
    llength [all_ffs] 
    15741 
    current_instance fftEngine 
    fftEngine 
    llength [all_ffs] 
    1519

  This example filters the results of all_ffs to return only the FDRE flops:

    filter [all_ffs] {REF_NAME == FDRE}
