Description:

  Returns a list of all multiplier (MULT) cell objects that have been
  declared in the current design. These MULT cell objects can be assigned to
  a variable or passed into another command.

  The all_mults command is scoped to return the objects hierarchically, from
  the top-level of the design or from the level of the current instance. By
  default the current instance is defined as the top level of the design, but
  can be changed by using the current_instance command.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example returns a list of all MULTs in the current design:

    all_mults

  The following example shows how the list returned can be passed to another
  command:

    set_false_path -from [all_mults] -to [all_registers]
