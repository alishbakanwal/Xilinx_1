Description:

  This command configures features of the report_design_analysis command.

  The design analysis report analyzes timing paths at various stages in the
  Vivado tool flow, including synthesis, optimization, placement, routing.
  The -max_common_paths option specifies how many setup timing paths to
  capture at each stage in the flow.

  Note: This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it
  fails.

Arguments:

  -max_common_paths <arg> - (Optional) The number of paths to consider when
  examining the distribution of common paths across phases of implementation.
  Specified as an integer value less than 20,000, the default is 1000.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example ignores the package delays during timing analysis:

    config_design_analysis 500
