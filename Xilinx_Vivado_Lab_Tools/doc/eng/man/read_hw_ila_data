Description:

  Read ILA debug core data from the specified file, and create an hw_ila_data
  object.

  The ILA debug sample data is acquired from a running device using the
  upload_hw_ila_data command. This creates a hw_ila_data object that can be
  written to a file on disk using the write_hw_ila_data command. This command
  reads that ILA data file.

  The hw_ila_data object that is created by read_hw_ila_data is named after
  the <file> it is read from. If a hw_ila_data object of the same name
  already exists, the name of the object is assigned a number extension
  starting at 1: <file> _1.

  The new hw_ila_data object is not connected with, or associated with, any
  ILA debug cores in the design.

  After being read from disk, the ILA debug data can be viewed in the
  waveform viewer of the Vivado logic analyzer by using the
  display_hw_ila_data command.

  This command returns an ILA data object, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - (Required) The name of ILA data file to read. If the file
  extension is not specified, the Vivado tool assumes an extension of .ila.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the tool will
  search for the specified file in the current working directory and then in
  the directory from which the tool was launched.

Example:

  The following example reads the specified ILA data file, and creates a
  hw_ila_data object named after the file:

    read_hw_ila_data C:/Data/hw_ila_data_2.ila
