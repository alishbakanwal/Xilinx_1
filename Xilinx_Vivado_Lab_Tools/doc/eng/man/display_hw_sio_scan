Description:

  This command is intended for use with the graphical user interface of the
  Vivado Design Suite serial I/O analyzer feature. It displays the specified
  SIO scan data object, or objects, in a Scan Plots window of the Vivado IDE.

  The SIO scan data can be read from a file on disk using the
  read_hw_sio_scan command, or from a hw_sio_scan object created by the
  run_hw_sio_scan command. The type of plot displayed is determined by the
  <scan_type> of the hw_sio_scan object.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_sio_scans> - (Optional) Specify one or more existing hw_sio_scan
  objects to display in Scan Plot windows in the Hardware Manager feature of
  the Vivado IDE.

Example:

  The following example reads an SIO scan data file into memory, and displays
  the hw_sio_scan object that is created:

    display_hw_sio_scan [read_hw_sio_scan C:/Data/loopback1.csv]
