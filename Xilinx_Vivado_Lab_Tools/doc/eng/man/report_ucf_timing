Description:

  Report timing for designs with UCF constraints.

Arguments:

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file. The
  specified file will be overwritten if one already exists, unless -append is
  also specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -name <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the name of the results set for the GUI.

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string rather than
  to the standard output. The Tcl string can be captured by a variable
  definition and parsed or otherwise processed.

  Note: This argument cannot be used with the -file option.

  -speed [ -1 | -2 | -3 ] - (Optional) Specify the speed grade for the device
  to report. When not specified, the default is -2.

  -from <args> - (Optional) The starting points of the timing paths to be
  analyzed. Ports, pins, or cells can be specified as timing path
  startpoints. You can also specify a clock object, and all startpoints
  clocked by the named clock will be analyzed.

  -to <args> - (Optional) The endpoints, or destination objects of timing
  paths to be analyzed. Ports, pins, and cell objects can be specified as
  endpoints. A clock object can also be specified, in which case endpoints
  clocked by the named clock are analyzed.

  -thru <args> - (Optional) Consider only paths through the specified pins,
  cell instance, or nets during timing analysis. You can specify individual
  -through points in sequence to define a specific path through the design
  for analysis. The order of the specified through points is important to
  define a specific path. You can also specify through points with multiple
  objects, in which case the timing path can pass through any of the
  specified through objects.

  -min_max [ min | max ] - (Optional) Run max (setup) or min (hold) timing
  analysis.

  -transition [ rise | fall ] - (Optional) Report rising or falling edge
  transitions.

  -sort_by [ slack | group ] - (Optional) Sort timing paths in the report by
  slack values, or by path group. Valid values are slack or group. By
  default, the report_timing command reports the worst, or -nworst, timing
  paths in the design. However, with -sort_by group, the report_timingcommand
  returns the worst, or -nworst, paths of each path group.

  Note: Each clock creates a path group. Path groups can also be defined with
  the group_path command.

  -interconnect_type <arg> - (Optional) Interconnect delay type

  -max_paths <arg> - (Optional) The maximum number of paths to output when
  sorted by slack; or the maximum number of paths per path group when sorted
  by group, as specified by -sort_by. This is specified as a value greater
  than or equal to 1. By default the report_timing command will report the
  single worst timing path, or the worst path per path group.

  -nworst <arg> - (Optional) The number of timing paths to output in the
  timing report. The timing report will return the <N> worst paths based on
  the specified value, greater than or equal to 1. The default setting is 1.

  -required_times - (Optional) Calculate all required times.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example returns the timing:

    report_ucf_timing
