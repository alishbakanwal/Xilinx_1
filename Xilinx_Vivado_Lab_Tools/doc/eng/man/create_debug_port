Description:

  Defines a new port to be added to an existing Vivado ILA debug core that
  was added to the design using the create_debug_core command. The port
  provides connection points on an ILA core to attach nets from the design
  for debugging.

  When a new debug core is created using the create_debug_core command, it
  includes a CLK and PROBE port by default. However, you can add trigger
  input/output port types as well. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User
  Guide: Programming and Debugging (UG908) for more information on port types
  and purpose.

  A port can have one or more connection points to support one or more nets
  to debug. As a default new ports are defined as having a width of 1,
  allowing only one net to be attached. You can change the port width of
  PROBE ports to support multiple signals using the set_property port_width
  command (see Examples).

  Note: CLK, TRIG_IN, TRIG_IN_ACK, TRIG_OUT, and TRIG_OUT_ACK ports can only
  have a width of 1.

  You can connect signals to ports using the connect_debug_port command, and
  disconnect signals with the disconnect_debug_port command.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) The name of the ILA debug core to add the new port to.
  The debug core must already exist in the project having been created with
  create_debug_core.

  <type> - (Required) The type of debug port to insert. The supported port
  types are:

   *  CLK - Defines the clock port for connecting the ILA debug core to a
      clock domain. Each debug core can only have one CLK port, and each CLK
      port can only connect to one clock domain. Therefore you must use
      multiple ILA cores to probe signals from different clock domains.

      Note: Ensure that the connected clocks are free-running clocks. Failure
      to do so could result in an inability to communicate with the debug
      core when the design is loaded onto the device.

   *  PROBE - Provides probe points to connect to signals that are marked for
      debugging with the MARK_DEBUG property. The ILA debug core can contain
      multiple PROBE ports, which are automatically numbered by the Vivado
      tool when the port is added to the core. Each PROBE port can contain
      one or more channels, or connection points, as defined by the
      PORT_WIDTH property.

   *  TRIG_IN/TRIG_IN_ACK, and TRIG_OUT/TRIG_OUT_ACK - The ILA probe trigger
      comparators used to detect specific comparison conditions on the PROBE
      inputs to the ILA core. TRIG_IN and TRIG_IN_ACK, and TRIG_OUT and
      TRIG_OUT_ACK should be added to the debug core as port pairs when used.
      Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Programming and Debugging
      (UG908) for more information.

Examples:

  The following example creates a new debug core, and then adds an additional
  PROBE port to the core, then sets the width of that new port to 8, and
  connects signals to the PROBE port:

    create_debug_core myCore ila 
    create_debug_port myCore PROBE 
    set_property PORT_WIDTH 8 myCore/PROBE1  
    connect_debug_port -channel_start_index 1 myCore/PROBE1 \ 
    {m1_cyc_i m1_ack_o m1_err_o m1_rty_o}

  Note: Recall that the ILA core is created with a CLK and PROBE port by
  default, so the new PROBE port is automatically numbered as PROBE1.
