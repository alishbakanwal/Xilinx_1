Description:

  Defines the current IP subsystem design for use with the IP Integrator
  feature of the Vivado Design Suite, or returns the name of the current
  design in the active project.

  The current IP subsystem design and current IP subsystem instance are the
  target of most of the IP integrator Tcl commands and design changes made in
  the tool. The current IP subsystem instance can be defined using the
  current_bd_instance command.

  You can use the get_bd_designs command to get a list of open IP subsystem
  designs in the active project.

  A complete list of IP integrator Tcl commands can be returned using the
  following command from the Vivado Design Suite Tcl shell:

    load_features IPIntegrator 
    help -category IPintegrator

  Note: The load_features command is only needed if the IP Integrator feature
  is not currently loaded in the Vivado Design Suite.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <design> - (Optional) The name of an IP subsystem design to set as the
  current design in the IP Integrator. If a <design> is not specified, the
  command returns the current IP subsystem design of the active project.

Examples:

  The following example sets the IP subsystem design as the current design:

    current_bd_design design_1
