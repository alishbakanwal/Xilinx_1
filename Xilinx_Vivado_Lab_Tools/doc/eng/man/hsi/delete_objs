Description:

  Delete specified objects from the current software design.

  Objects must be passed directly to the delete_objs command, and not
  simply referenced by the object name. 

  This command returns nothing if it is successful, and returns an error if
  it fails.


Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - A list of objects to delete from the current software design.


Example:

  The following example deletes the various objects from the current
  software design:

    delete_objs [get_libs xilffs] [get_drivers gpio]
