Description:

  Get a list of params in drivers/os/nodes in the current software design. 

Arguments:

  -regexp - (Optional) Specifies that the search <patterns> are written as
  regular expressions. Both search <patterns> and -filter expressions must be
  written as regular expressions when this argument is used. Xilinx regular
  expression Tcl commands are always anchored to the start of the search
  string. You can add ".*" to the beginning or end of a search string to
  widen the search to include a substring. See
  http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/re_syntax.htm for help with regular
  expression syntax.

  Note: The Tcl built-in command regexp is not anchored, and works as a
  standard Tcl command. For more information refer to
  http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/regexp.htm.

  -filter <args> - (Optional) Filter the results list with the specified
  expression. The -filter argument filters the list of objects returned by
  get_cells based on property values on the cells. You can find the
  properties on an object with the report_property or list_property commands.
  In the case of the param object, "NAME", "VALUE" 
  are some of the properties that can be used to filter results.

  The filter search pattern should be quoted to avoid having to escape
  special characters that may be found in net, pin, or cell names, or other
  properties. String matching is case-sensitive and is always anchored to the
  start and to the end of the search string. The wildcard "*" character can
  be used at the beginning or at the end of a search string to widen the
  search to include a substring of the property value.

  Note: The filter returns an object if a specified property exists on the
  object, and the specified pattern matches the property value on the object.
  In the case of the "*" wildcard character, this will match a property with
  a defined value of ""

  For string comparison, the specific operators that can be used in filter
  expressions are "equal" (==), "not-equal" (!=), "match" (=~), and
  "not-match" (!~). Numeric comparison operators <, >, <=, and >= can also be
  used. Multiple filter expressions can be joined by AND and OR (&& and ||).
  The following gets params that matches NAME and VALUE 
  within their name:

    get_comp_params -filter {NAME == clock-names && VALUE == "ref_clk aper_clk"}


  -of_objects <arg> - (Optional) Get 'param' objects of these types: 'sw_driver', 
      'sw_os', 'sw_proc', 'sw_node'.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <patterns> - (Optional) Match sotfware design cells against the specified
  patterns. The default pattern is the wildcard `*` which gets a list of all
  cells in the current IP subsystem design. More than one pattern can be
  specified to find multiple cells based on different search criteria.

  Note: You must enclose multiple search patterns in braces {} to present the
  list as a single element.


Examples:

  The following example gets a list of params that include the specified driver in
  Software design:

    get_comp_params -of_objects [get_drivers ps7_uart_0] 

  The following example gets a list of all params of OS: 
    
    get_comp_params -of_objects [get_os]
