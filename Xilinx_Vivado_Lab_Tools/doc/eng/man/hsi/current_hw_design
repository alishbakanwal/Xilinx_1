Description:

  Defines the current Hardware design for use with the tool, or returns 
  the name of the current design in the active project.

  The current hardware design is the target of the hardware Tcl commands. 

  You can use the get_hw_designs command to get a list of open hardware 
  designs in the active project.
 

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <design> - (Optional) The name of an hardware design to set as the
  current design in the tool. If a <design> is not specified, the
  command returns the current hardware design of the active project.


Examples:

  The following example sets the hardware design as the current design:

    current_hw_design design_1
    current_hw_design
