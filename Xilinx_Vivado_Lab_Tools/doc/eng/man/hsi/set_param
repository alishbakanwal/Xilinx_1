Description:

  Sets the value of a user-definable configuration parameter. These
  parameters configure and control various behaviors of the tool. Refer to
  report_param for a description of currently defined parameters.

  You can use the reset_param command to restore any parameter that has been
  modified back to its default setting.

  Note: Setting a specified parameter value to -1 will disable the feature.


Arguments:

  <name> - (Required) The name of the parameter to set the value of. You can
  only set the value of one parameter at a time.

  <value> - (Required) The value to set the specified parameter to.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.


Examples:

    set_param messaging.defaultLimit 1000
