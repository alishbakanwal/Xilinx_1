Description:

  Creates a new property of the <type> specified with the user-defined <name>
  for the specified <class> of objects. The property that is created can be
  assigned to an object of the specified class with the set_property command,
  but is not automatically associated with all objects of that class.

  The report_property -all command will not report the newly created property
  for an object of the specified class until the property has been assigned
  to that object.


Arguments:

  -description <arg> - (Optional) Provide a description of the property being
  created. The description will be returned by the tool help system when the 
  property is queried.

  -type <arg> - (Optional) The type of property to create. There allowed
  property types include:

   *  string - Allows the new property to be defined with string values. This
      is the default value when -type is not specified.

   *  int - Allows the new property to be defined with short four-byte signed
      integer values with a range of -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. If a
      floating point value is specified for an int property type, the HSM
      tool will return an error.

   *  long - Specifies signed 64-bit integers with value range of
      -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. If a floating
      point value is specified for an long property type, the tool will
      return an error.

   *  double - Allows the new property value to be defined with a floating
      point number.

   *  bool - Allows the new property to be defined as a boolean with a true
      (1, or yes) or false (0, or no) value.

   *  enum - An enumerated data type, with the valid enumerated values
      specified by the -enum_values option.

   *  string_list - A Tcl list of string values.

   *  int_list - A Tcl list of integer values.

   *  double_list - A Tcl list of floating point values.

  -enum_values <args> - (Optional) A list of enumerated values that the
  property can have. The list must be enclosed in braces, {}, with values
  separated by spaces. This option can only be used with -type enum.

  -default_value <args> - (Optional) The default value to assign to the
  property. This option can be used for string, int, bool, and enum type
  properties.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) The name of the property to be defined. The name is
  case sensitive.

  <class> - (Required) The class of object to assign the new property to. All
  objects of the specified class will be assigned the newly defined property.
  Valid classes are: design, net, cell, pin, port, Pblock, interface, and
  fileset.


Examples:

  The following example defines a property called PURPOSE for cell objects:

    create_property PURPOSE cell

  Note: Because the -type was not specified, the value will default to strings.

  The following example creates a pin property called COUNT which holds an
  Integer value:

    create_property -type int COUNT pin
