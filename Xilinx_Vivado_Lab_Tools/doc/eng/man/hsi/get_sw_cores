Description:

  Get a list of SW cores defined in the SW repository of the current session,
  based on the specified search pattern. The default is to return all SW
  cores defined in the repo.


Arguments:

  -regexp - (Optional) Specifies that the search <patterns> are written as
  regular expressions. Both search <patterns> and -filter expressions must be
  written as regular expressions when this argument is used. Xilinx regular
  expression Tcl commands are always anchored to the start of the search
  string. You can add ".*" to the beginning or end of a search string to
  widen the search to include a substring. See
  http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/re_syntax.htm for help with regular
  expression syntax.

  Note: The Tcl built-in command regexp is not anchored, and works as a
  standard Tcl command. For more information refer to
  http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/regexp.htm.


  -filter <args> - Filter the results list with the specified expression. The
  -filter argument filters the list of objects returned by get_sw_cores based
  on property values on the objects. You can find the properties on an object
  with the report_property or list_property commands. In the case of the
  "sw_cores" object, "NAME", "CORE_STATE" and "TYPE" are some of the 
  properties that can be used to filter results.

  The filter search pattern should be quoted to avoid having to escape
  special characters that may be found in net, pin, or cell names, or other
  properties. String matching is case-sensitive and is always anchored to the
  start and to the end of the search string. The wildcard "*" character can
  be used at the beginning or at the end of a search string to widen the
  search to include a substring of the property value.

  Note: The filter returns an object if a specified property exists on the
  object, and the specified pattern matches the property value on the object.
  In the case of the "*" wildcard character, this will match a property with
  a defined value of ""

  For string comparison, the specific operators that can be used in filter
  expressions are "equal" (==), "not-equal" (!=), "match" (=~), and
  "not-match" (!~). Numeric comparison operators <, >, <=, and >= can also be
  used. Multiple filter expressions can be joined by AND and OR (&& and ||).
  The following gets input pins that do NOT contain the "RESET" substring
  within their name:

    get_sw_cores * -filter {CORE_STATE == "DEPRECATED" && TYPE == "DRIVER"}

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <patterns> - (Optional) Match IP core definitions in the IP catalog against
  the specified search patterns. The default pattern is the wildcard `*`
  which gets a list of all IP cores in the catalog. More than one pattern can
  be specified to find multiple core definitions based on different search
  criteria.

  Note: You must enclose multiple search patterns in braces, {}, or quotes,
  "", to present the list as a single element.


Examples:

  The following example returns a list of all SW cores with TYPE property
  matching the specified pattern:

    get_sw_cores -filter {TYPE == "driver"}

  The following example returns a list of all SW cores with REPOSITORY property
  matching the specified pattern:

    get_sw_cores -filter {REPOSITORY=="C:/user/repo"}
