Description:

  Automatically detects existing or previously defined communication pathways
  between GT transmitters and receivers that are defined on the open hardware
  target.

  You can use this command if you change board connections while the serial
  I/O analyzer is running. The detection algorithm uses changing transmit
  patterns and detects links on received patterns to determine how GTs are
  connected to one another on the open hardware target.

  A transmitter or receiver of an individual GT on the IBERT debug core can
  only be used in one hw_sio_link at a time, so the command will not check
  GTs that are used in existing links. The -force option lets you clear all
  existing links before scanning the open hardware target to check all GTs.

  The detect_hw_sio_links command defines the found links, and creates a link
  group to associate the new links.

  This command returns the number of links found and the created
  hw_sio_linkgroup object, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -force - (Optional) Delete existing link objects and re-detect links by
  examining all GTs to ensure the current hardware configuration is properly
  reflected in the link definitions.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Example:

  The following example examines the IBERT debug core on the open hardware
  target to look for existing communication links:

    detect_hw_sio_links

  Note: Without the -force option, GTs used in existing links will not be
  examined.
