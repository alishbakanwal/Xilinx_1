Description:

  Adds specified logic instances to a Pblock in an open implemented design.
  Once cells have been added to a Pblock, you can place the Pblocks onto the
  fabric of the FPGA using the resize_pblock command. The resize_pblock
  command can also be used to manually move and resize Pblocks.

  You can remove instances from the Pblock using the remove_cells_from_pblock
  command.

Arguments:

  -top - (Optional) Add the top level instance to create a Pblock for the
  whole design. You must either specify <cells> or the -top option to add
  objects to the Pblock.

  -add_primitives - (Optional) Assign all primitives of the specified
  instances to a Pblock. This lets you select all cells in a hierarchical
  module, and assign only the leaf-cells of the selected cells to the
  specified Pblock.

  Note: This option cannot be used with -top .

  -clear_locs - (Optional) Clear instance location constraints for any cells
  that are already placed. This allows you to reset the LOC constraint for
  cells when defining new Pblocks for floorplanning purposes. When this
  option is not specified, any instances with assigned placement will not be
  unplaced as they are added to the Pblock.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <pblock> - The name assigned to the Pblock.

  <cells> - One or more cell objects to add to the specified Pblock.

  Note: If -top is specified, you cannot also specify <cells>.

Examples:

  The following example creates a Pblock called pb_cpuEngine, and then adds
  only the leaf-cells found in the cpuEngine module, clearing placement
  constraints for placed instances:

    create_pblock pb_cpuEngine 
    add_cells_to_pblock pb_cpuEngine [get_cells cpuEngine/*] \ 
       -add_primitives -clear_locs
