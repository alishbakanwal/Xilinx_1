Description:

  Populates the specified objects into the Find Results window in the Vivado
  IDE.

  Note: This command is only useful when run in the Vivado IDE. When run in
  Tcl or Batch mode the command simply returns without error or comment.

Arguments:

  -name <arg> - The name of the report tab to open in the Find Results
  window. If no name is specified, the default name of find_1 is provided.

  Note: If the command is run multiple times, without the -name option, each
  occurrence of show_objects will overwrite the prior results.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - The design objects to show in the Find Results window. The
  objects must be specified as design objects, and not just specified by
  name. Objects can be returned by commands like get_cells, get_pins,
  get_nets, or by all_inputs, and all_rams.

Examples:

  The following example shows all DSP objects in the current design in the
  Find Results window.

    show_objects -name All_DSPs [all_dsps]

  The following example shows all of the cells in the design hierarchy that
  are Clock or DSP PRIMITIVE_TYPEs:

    show_objects -name find_1 [get_cells -hierarchical \ 
    -filter { PRIMITIVE_TYPE =~ CLK.*.* || PRIMITIVE_TYPE =~ MULT.dsp.* } ]
