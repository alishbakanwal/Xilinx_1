Description:

  Imports a partition XML file into the current design. The PXML file
  contains partition information related to hierarchical design. A PXML file
  is created by the tool during synthesis or implementation. You can also
  create one by hand or by using an XML template provided in the tool
  installation directory. Refer to the Hierarchical Design Methodology Guide
  (UG748) for more information on partitioning designs and creating a PXML
  file.

  A partition must be defined to implement, or to import in the RTL design in
  order to be properly handled in synthesis and implementation. Therefore
  read_pxml must be used on an open RTL design.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - The name of the PXML file. The file must be named xpartition.pxml,
  or you will get an error when trying to read the file.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the tool will
  search for the specified file in the current working directory and then in
  the directory from which the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example reads the specified PXML file for partition
  information related to the hierarchy of the design:

    read_pxml C:/Data/FPGA_Design/pxmlTest.pxml
