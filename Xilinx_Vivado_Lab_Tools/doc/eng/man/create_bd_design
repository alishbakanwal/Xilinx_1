Description:

  Create a new IP subsystem design module to add to the current project, and
  for use with the IP Integrator feature of the Vivado Design Suite.

  An empty IP subsystem module is created and added to the source files of
  the current project. The subsystem module and file are created with the
  specified <name> in the current project at:

  <project_name> /<project_name>.srcs/sources_1/bd/<name> /<name>.bd

  This command returns the file path and name of the IP subsystem design
  created if the command is successful. An error is returned if the command
  fails.

  create_bd_design [-dir <arg>] [-cell <arg>] [-quiet] [-verbose] <name>

Arguments:

  -dir <arg> - (Optional) Specify the directory to write the block design
  file to. This lets you create and manage BD files outside of the current
  project directory structure, and facilitates reuse of block designs across
  multiple projects.

  -cell <arg> - (Optional) Specify a hierarchical bd_cell to use as the
  source of a new block design. Use this option to create new block design
  from a portion of an existing design. The cell can be specified by instance
  name or returned as an object by the get_bd_cells command.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - The name of the IP subsystem design module to create.

Example:

  The following example creates a new empty IP subsystem module called
  design_1, adds the module to the current project, and creates a file called
  design_1.bd in the sources directory of the project:

    create_bd_design design_1
