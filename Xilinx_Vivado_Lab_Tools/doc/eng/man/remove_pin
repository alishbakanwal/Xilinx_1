Description:

  Remove pins from the current netlist in either an open Synthesized or
  Implemented design.

  Note: You cannot remove pins from library macros, or macro-primitives.

  To remove a bus pin, you must specify the primary pin name, and not specify
  a bus index. This ensures that the entire bus pin is removed, and not just
  a portion of the bits associated with the bus. You can resize a bus pin,
  eliminating bits, using the resize_pin_bus command.

  Netlist editing changes the in-memory view of the netlist in the current
  design. It does not change the files in the source fileset, or change the
  persistent design on the disk. Changes made to the netlist may be saved to
  a design checkpoint using the write_checkpoint command, or may be exported
  to a netlist file such as Verilog, VHDL, or EDIF, using the appropriate
  write_* command.

  Note: Netlist editing is not allowed on the elaborated RTL design.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <pins> - (Required) List of pins to remove from the netlist. The pins must
  be specified hierarchically by the cell instance the pin is found on.

Examples:

  The following example removes the fftEngine from the in-memory netlist of
  the current design:

    remove_cell fftEngine
