Description:

  Sets the derating factor to be used when performing timing analysis. Timing
  delays calculated during timing analysis are multiplied by the specified
  derating factor.

  Note: This command operates silently and does not return direct feedback of
  its operation.

  You can set the derating factor for the design, and then you can specify
  objects to set specific derating values for cells, clocks, or nets in the
  design. To set derating values for the design simply issue the command with
  no <objects> specified.

  You can restore the derating factor for the design using the
  reset_timing_derate command.

Arguments:

  -early - (Optional) The derating factor for the shortest paths.

  -late - (Optional) The derating factor for the longest paths.

  -clock - (Optional) Apply the derating factor to clock paths only.

  -data - (Optional) Apply the derating factor to data paths only.

  -net_delay - (Optional) Apply the derating factor is to net delays only.

  -cell_delay - (Optional) Apply the derating factor for cell delay checks
  only.

  -cell_check - (Optional) Apply the derating factor is to for cell timing
  checks only.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <derate> - The derating factor to be applied. The default value is 1.0. The
  derating factor can be specified as a floating point number between 0 and
  1. A derating factor of 0.9 derates performance by 10%.

  <objects> - A list of the objects to be derated. If no objects are
  specified, the derating factor is applied globally to the design.

Examples:

  The following example derates the performance of High-Speed IO clock paths
  by 20%:

    
    set_timing_derate -clock 0.8 [all_hsios]
