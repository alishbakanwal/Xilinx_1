Description:

  Optimizes the dynamic power consumption of the design by changing clock
  gating to take advantage of clock enable on a flop. Clock gating
  optimizations are automatically performed on the entire design to improve
  power consumption while making no changes to the existing logic or the
  clocks that would alter the behavior of the design.

  You can configure the power optimization to include or exclude specific
  cells using the set_power_opt command.

  Note: Block RAM power optimizations are performed by default with the
  opt_design command. You can disable BRAM optimization by changing the
  defaults of opt_design, or by excluding specific cells from optimization
  using the set_power_opt command.

  You can also use the read_saif command prior to optimization, and
  power_opt_design will consider the activity data while optimizing the
  design.

  You can run power optimization after synthesis, or after placement. When
  run before placement, this command optimizes the design to save power. When
  run after placement, this command optimizes the design to save power while
  preserving timing. Running after placement limits the optimizations
  available to the power_opt_design command. To achieve the best results, the
  command should be run prior to placement.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example performs power optimization of the open design:

    power_opt_design

  This example optimizes the design, excluding the BRAM power optimization by
  specifying the optimizations to run, and then runs power optimization on
  the design:

    opt_design -retarget -propconst -sweep 
    power_opt_design
