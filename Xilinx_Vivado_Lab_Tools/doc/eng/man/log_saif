Description:

  Writes the switching activity rates for the specified HDL signals during
  the current simulation.

  The Switching Activity Interchange format (SAIF) file is an ASCII file
  containing header information, and toggle counts for the specified signals
  of the design. It also contains the timing attributes which specify time
  durations for signals at level 0, 1, X, or Z.

  The log_saif command can only be used after the open_saif command has
  opened an SAIF file in the current simulation to capture switching activity
  rates.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hdl_objects> - Specifies the HDL signal names on which to capture code.

Examples:

  The following example logs switching activity for all signals in the
  current_scope:

    log_saif [ get_objects ]

  Log SAIF for only the internal signals starting with name c of the scope
  /tb/UUT:

    log_saif [get_objects -filter { type == internal_signal }/tb/UUT/c*]
