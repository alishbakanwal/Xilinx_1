Description:

  Resets the specified operating conditions to their default values. If no
  operating conditions are specified, all operating conditions are reset to
  their default values.

  Operating conditions can be set using the set_operating_conditions command.
  The current values can be determined using the report_operating_conditions
  command. The environmental operating conditions of the device are used for
  power analysis when running the report_power command, but are not used
  during timing analysis.

  Note: This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it
  fails.

Arguments:

  -voltage <args> - (Optional) Reset the voltage supply to the default value.
  The voltage supply and its default depend on the device family.

  -grade - (Optional) ) Reset the temperature grade of the selected device.
  The default value is "commercial".

  -process - (Optional) Reset the manufacturing process for the target
  device. The default process is "typical".

  -junction_temp - (Optional) Reset the junction temperature for the target
  device. The default value is "auto".

  -ambient_temp - (Optional) Reset the ambient temperature of the design. The
  default setting is "default".

  -thetaja - (Optional) Reset the Theta-JA thermal resistance. The default
  setting is "auto".

  -thetasa - (Optional) Reset the Theta-SA thermal resistance. The default
  setting is "auto".

  -airflow - (Optional) Reset the Linear Feet Per Minute (LFM) airflow. The
  default setting varies by device family.

  -heatsink - (Optional) Reset the heatsink profile. The default setting is
  "medium".

  -thetajb - (Optional) Reset the Theta-JB thermal resistance. The default
  setting is "auto".

  -board - (Optional) Reset the board size to be used for modeling. The
  default value is "medium".

  -board_temp arg - (Optional) Reset the board temperature to the default
  setting.

  -board_layers - (Optional) Reset the number of board layers to be used for
  modeling to the default setting of "12to15".

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example resets all the operating conditions for the design to
  their default setting:

    reset_operating_conditions

  The following example resets the junction, ambient, and board temperature
  for the design to their default settings:

    reset_operating_conditions -junction_temp -ambient_temp -board_temp

  The following example resets the voltage supply Vccint to its default value:

    reset_operating_conditions -voltage Vccint
