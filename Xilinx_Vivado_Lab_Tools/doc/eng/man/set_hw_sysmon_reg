Description:

  Set the system monitor register at the specified address to the hex value
  specified. This command identifies a register on the hw_sysmon on the
  current device through its hex address value, and sets the specified hex
  data value into that register.

  Note: Some of the registers on the system monitor are read-only and cannot
  be set directly. This command has no effect if you try to set the value of
  a read-only register on the system monitor.

  The System Monitor (SYSMON) Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) is used to
  measure die temperature and voltage on the hw_device. The Sysmon monitors
  the physical environment via on-chip temperature and supply sensors. The
  ADC can access up to 17 external analog input channels.

  Data for the system monitor is stored in dedicated registers, called status
  and control registers, accessible through the get_hw_sysmon_reg and
  set_hw_sysmon_reg commands. Refer to the Register Interface in UltraScale
  Architecture System Monitor User Guide (UG580), or 7 Series FPGAs and
  Zynq-7000 All Programmable SoC XADC Dual 12-Bit 1 MSPS Analog-to-Digital
  Converter User Guide (UG480) for more information on the addresses of
  specific system monitor registers.

  Although the set_hw_sysmon_reg command lets you directly write the
  specified hex data value into the registers of a system monitor, the
  recommended procedure is to update the values of properties on the
  hw_sysmon object using the set_property command, and then write the
  property values to the hw_sysmon object using the commit_hw_sysmon command.

  The set_hw_sysmon_reg command writes the specified hex value to the
  hw_sysmon_reg object on the hw_sysmon object at the specified address but
  returns nothing, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_sysmon> - (Required) Specify the hw_sysmon object to set the registers
  of. The hw_sysmon object must be specified as an object returned by the
  get_hw_sysmon command.

  <hexaddress> - (Required) Specify the hex address of the status register on
  the system monitor to set the value of.

  <hexdata> - (Required) Specify the data, as a hex value, to populate into
  the register defined by the hex address.

Example:

  The following example sets the specified hex data value into the register
  at the hex address of the system monitor on the current hardware device:

    set_hw_sysmon_reg [current_hw_device] 00 9D28
