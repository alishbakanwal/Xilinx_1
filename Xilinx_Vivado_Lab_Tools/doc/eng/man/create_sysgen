Description:

  Create a DSP sub-module for use in the current project, and add it to the
  source files.

  This command will launch System Generator for DSP to let you design the
  hardware portion of your system design. System Generator is a DSP design
  tool from Xilinx that allows the RTL source files, Simulink<tm
  tmtype="reg"/> and MATLAB<tm tmtype="reg"/> software models, and C/C++
  components of a DSP system to come together in a single simulation and
  implementation environment.

  For more information on using specific features of the tool refer to System
  Generator for DSP Getting Started Guide (UG639).

  You can also add existing DSP model files (.mdl) from System Generator into
  the current project using the add_files command.

  The command returns the name of the DSP module created and added to the
  project.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) The name of the DSP module to create and add to the
  current project.

Examples:

  The following example launches System Generator and allows you to define
  and configure the specified DSP module:

    create_sysgen DSP_mod1
