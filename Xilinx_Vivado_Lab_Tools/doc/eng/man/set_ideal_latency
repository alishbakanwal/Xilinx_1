Description:

  Sets the latency of ideal networks for the specified ports or pins. Latency
  is specified in nanoseconds.

  Note: This command operates silently and does not return direct feedback of
  its operation.

  Ideal networks are used for timing analysis before the clock network is
  propagated.

Arguments:

  -rise - (Optional) Apply the latency value to rising edges.

  -fall - (Optional) Apply the latency value to falling edges.

  Note: When neither -rise or -fall is specified, both are assumed.

  -min - (Optional) Use the latency value as the minimum ideal latency.

  -max - (Optional) Use the latency value as the maximum ideal latency.

  Note: When neither -min or -max is specified, both are assumed.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <value> - The latency value for ideal networks. Latency is specified in
  nanoseconds (ns), as a floating point delay value >= 0.

  <objects> - The list of ports or pins on which to apply the latency.

Examples:

  The following example defines the ideal latency for all inputs ports:

    set_ideal_latency 1.5 [all_inputs]
