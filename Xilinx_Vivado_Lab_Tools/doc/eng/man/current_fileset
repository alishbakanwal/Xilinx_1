Description:

  Get the active source, constraint, or simulation fileset within the current
  project.

  When used without any options, current_fileset sets and returns the
  sources_1 set as the active fileset.

  This command can also be used to set the current simulation fileset.

  Note: Use set_property CONSTRSET to define the active constraint set on a
  synthesis or implementation run.

Arguments:

  -constrset - (Optional) Return the currently active constraint set.

  -simset - (Optional) Return or set the currently active simulation fileset.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <fileset> - (Optional) The name of the simulation fileset to make active.
  This argument sets the active simulation fileset in projects with multiple
  filesets. When <fileset> is not specified, the sources_1 fileset is
  returned as the active fileset.

Examples:

  The following example returns the name of the currently active constraint
  fileset:

    current_fileset -constrset

  The following example sets sim_2 as the active simulation set:

    current_fileset -simset sim_2
