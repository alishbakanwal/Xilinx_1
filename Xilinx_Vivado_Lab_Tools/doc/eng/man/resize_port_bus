Description:

  Resize an existing bus port, to grow the bus, shrink the bus, or renumber
  the current range of port indexes. You can only do a single grow, shrink,
  or renumber operation with each command.

   *  You can grow the bus by indicating a new range of port indexes outside
      the current range of indexes. Growing the bus leaves existing port
      indexes connected as they currently are.

   *  You can shrink the bus by indicating a new range of port indexes inside
      the current range of indexes. Shrinking the bus, eliminates connections
      to removed bus ports, but leaves the remaining ports connected as they
      currently are.

   *  You can renumber the current bus indexes by providing a new range of
      port indexes with the same width as the current range. Renumbering
      ports changes the port index, but does not otherwise change
      connections.

  Netlist editing changes the in-memory view of the netlist in the current
  design. It does not change the files in the source fileset, or change the
  persistent design on the disk. Changes made to the netlist may be saved to
  a design checkpoint using the write_checkpoint command, or may be exported
  to a netlist file such as Verilog, VHDL, or EDIF, using the appropriate
  write_* command.

  Note: Netlist editing is not allowed on the elaborated RTL design.

  This command returns nothing if successful, and returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -from <arg> - (Optional) The new starting index of the specified bus port.

  -to <arg> - (Optional) The new ending index of the specified bus port.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <bus_port_name> - (Required) The name of the bus port to modify.

Examples:

  The following example creates a 32-bit output bus port, then renumbers the
  ports to include negative bus indexes, then shrinks the bus width from
  32-bits to 16-bits:

    create_port -direction out -from 0 -to 31 outPorts 
    resize_port_bus -from -16 -to 15 outPorts 
    resize_port_bus -from -8 -to 7 outPorts
