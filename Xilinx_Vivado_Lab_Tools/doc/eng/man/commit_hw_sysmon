Description:

  The commit_hw_sysmon command takes the current property values defined on a
  hw_sysmon object, and commits them to the system monitor registers on the
  hardware device.

  When you change the property values on the hw_sysmon object, like the
  CONFIG.* properties, they are not written to the hardware device until you
  use the commit_hw_sysmon command.

  This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_objects> - (Optional) Commit the properties of the specified hw_sysmon
  object. The system monitor object can be specified as the hw_sysmon object,
  or as the system monitor through the associated hw_device, hw_target, or
  hw_server objects.

  Note: The objects must be specified using the appropriate get_hw_xxx
  command, for instance get_hw_sysmon, rather than specified by name.

Example:

  The following example sets the unipolar/bipolar configuration register
  property on the hw_sysmon object, and then commits that value to the system
  monitor of the current hardware device:

    set_property CONFIG_REG.BU 1 [get_hw_sysmon] 
    commit_hw_sysmon [lindex [get_hw_sysmons] 0]
