Description:

  Note: You must first define the project as a Partial Reconfiguration (PR)
  project by setting the PR_FLOW property on the project to TRUE, or by using
  the <uicontrol>Tools > Enable Partial Reconfiguration</uicontrol> command.

  The Partial Reconfiguration flow lets you create Partition Definitions
  (partitionDefs) from hierarchical cells in a design, and to specify
  reconfigurable modules (RMs) to be assigned to these partitionDefs to
  create a unique configurations of the design based on the combination of
  the core design and one or more RMs. The PR design flow requires the
  implementation of each PR configuration, resulting in partial bitstreams
  for the RMs, but complete bitstreams for each integrated configuration.
  Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Partial Reconfiguration
  (UG909) for more information.

  The create_partition_def command defines a partitionDef object in a PR
  project from a specified hierarchical cell. The partitionDef defines a
  partition hierarchy that RMs can be assigned to for a specific PR
  configuration.

  This command returns the name of the newly created partitionDef, or returns
  an error if the command fails.

Arguments:

  -name <arg> - (Required) The name to assign to the new partitionDef.

  -module <arg> - (Required) The name of the hierarchical cell or module in
  the current project that defines the partitionDef. The hierarchical cell
  can be specified by name. The module specifies the hierarchical boundary of
  the partition definition. Reconfigurable modules (RMs) will be defined to
  fit within the hierarchical boundary of the partitionDef.

  -library <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the library name to assign to the
  partitionDef. If no library is specified, the xil_defaultlib is used.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Example:

  The following example sets the PR_FLOW property on the current project,
  defines a new partitionDef and assigns the specified module, and then
  creates the reconfigurable module from the specified hierarchy:

    set_property PR_FLOW 1 [current_project]  
    create_partition_def -name partDef1 -module fftTop \ 
    -library xil_defaultlib 
    create_reconfig_module -name fftTop -define_from fftTop \ 
    -partition_def [get_partition_defs partDef1]
