Description:

  Returns the board in use in the current project.

  The board file, board.xml located in the data/boards folder of the Vivado
  Design Suite installation area, stores information regarding board
  attributes. The board provides a representation of the overall system that
  the Xilinx device is a part of, and can help define key aspects of the
  design, such as clock constraints, I/O port assignments, and supported
  interfaces. You can create custom boards by defining a custom Board
  Interface file, as described in the Vivado Design Suite User Guide:
  System-Level Design Entry (UG895).

  The board can be specified:

   *  When the project is created by selecting Boards from the Default Part
      dialog box.

   *  By setting the BOARD_PART property on the current project as shown in
      the example.

   *  By selecting the Project Device in the Project Settings dialog box in
      an open project in the Vivado IDE.

  Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: System-Level Design Entry
  (UG895) for information on creating projects, and on configuring project
  settings.

  Note: When you specify the board with the set_property command, the target
  part is also changed to match the part required by the specified BOARD
  property.

  The current_board command returns the Vendor:Board_Name:File_Version
  attributes of the current board, as defined in the BOARD_PART property. The
  command returns nothing when the project targets a Xilinx FPGA device
  instead of a TRD and board, or when the BOARD_PART property has not been
  defined. The command returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Example:

  The following example sets the BOARD property for the current project, then
  reports the board in use by the project:

    set_property BOARD_PART xilinx.com:kc705:1.0 [current_project] 
    current_board 
       xilinx.com:kintex7:kc705:1.0

  This example shows the results of setting the BOARD_PART property, causing
  the target part to be changed as a result. The target part, as defined in
  the PART property, is changed automatically, and a warning is returned:

    set_property BOARD_PART xilinx.com:ac701:1.0 [current_project] 
       WARNING: [Project 1-153] The current project part `xc7k325tffg900-2` does  
       not match with the `XILINX.COM:AC701:1.0` board part settings. The project  
       part will be reset to `XILINX.COM:AC701:1.0` board part.

  Note: You can use the report_property command to check the BOARD_PART and
  PART property on the current_project to see the changes.
