Description:

  Assign ports to the pins of the Xilinx FPGA package, by automatically or
  manually placing ports.

   *  Automatically places ports on an available I/O or clocking site, or
      into the specified I/O banks.

   *  Manually assigns ports to the specified package_pin when both the port
      and pin are specified.

  The place_ports command will not replace ports that are currently placed by
  the user, or ports that are placed and fixed.

  Note: This command operates silently and does not return direct feedback of
  its operation.

Arguments:

  -skip_unconnected_ports - (Optional) Do not place unconnected ports.

  -check_only - (Optional) Run the clock placer DRCs, which are also
  available as PLCK checks in the report_drc command. This option does not
  result in ports being placed, only checked for valid placement.

  -iobank <args> - (Optional) Place the specified ports into the listed IO
  bank objects. IO bank objects are returned by the get_iobanks command.

  Note: Limiting port placement to specific IO banks will result in a
  placement error if there are insufficient placement sites for the number of
  ports being placed.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <ports> - (Optional) The names of the ports to be placed.

   *  If no <ports> are specified, all unplaced ports will be placed.

   *  Ports can be specified in <port_name> and <package_pin> pairs to
      manually assign ports to the specified package_pin. Multiple port_name
      package_pin pairs can be specified as follows:

        {<port_name1> <package_pin1> 
         <port_name2> <package_pin2>  
        <port_name2> <package_pin2>... 
        port_nameN> <package_pinN> }

  Note: If previously placed ports are specified, or included in the list of
  ports to place, the Vivado tool will not replace or move those ports.

Examples:

  The following example places the port objects returned by the get_ports
  command, onto I/O bank 13 of the device, as returned by get_iobanks:

    place_ports -iobank [get_iobanks 13] [get_ports DataOut_pad_1_o]

  The follow example uses port_name package_pin pairs to manually place
  multiple ports:

    place_ports {LEDS_n[2] AA11 LEDS_n[3] AA10 LEDS_n[0] Y11 LEDS_n[1] Y10}

  The following example places all input ports onto I/O banks 12, 13, 14 and
  15 of the device:

    place_ports -iobank [get_iobanks {12 13 14 15}] [all_inputs]
