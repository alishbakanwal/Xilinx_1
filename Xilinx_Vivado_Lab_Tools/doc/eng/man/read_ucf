Description:

  Imports physical constraints from a user constraint file (UCF). The UCF can
  be imported at the top-level, which is the default, or at a specific
  cell-level. When imported at the top-level, the specified UCF file is added
  to the active constraint fileset.

  Note: Constraints from the UCF file will overwrite any current constraints
  of the same name. Therefore, exercise some caution when reading a UCF file
  to be sure you will not overwrite important constraints.

  This command is similar to the add_files command in that the UCF file is
  added by reference rather than imported into the local project directory.

Arguments:

  <file> - The file name of the UCF file to be imported.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the tool will
  search for the specified file in the current working directory and then in
  the directory from which the tool was launched.

  -cell <arg> - The name of a hierarchical cell in the current design to
  import the UCF file into. The constraints will be applied to the specified
  block, and the imported UCF file will not be added to the active constraint
  fileset.

  Note: A design must be open when specifying the -cell option.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example reads the specified UCF file into the top-level of
  the design:

    read_ucf C:/Data/FPGA_Design/top1.ucf
