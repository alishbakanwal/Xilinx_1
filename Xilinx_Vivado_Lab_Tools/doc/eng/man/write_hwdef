Description:

  Writes a hardware definition (.hwdef) file for use in the software
  development tools (SDK).

  The write_hwdef command is intended to simplify the movement of designs
  from the Vivado Design Suite to software development in SDK. This command
  is run automatically by the Vivado Design Suite when generating the output
  products for a top-level design that includes a block design with an
  embedded processor like MicroBlaze, or Zynq-7000 All Programmable SoC.
  Block designs are created in the IP Integrator feature of the Vivado Design
  Suite with the create_bd_design command.

  The write_hwdef command is run after place_design and creates a hardware
  container file with .hwdef extension. The container file includes device
  metadata and hardware design files.

  The write_hwdef command returns nothing if successful, or an error if the
  command fails.

Arguments:

  -force - (Optional) Overwrite and existing hardware definition file if one
  exists. If this option is not specified, then the Vivado Design Suite will
  not overwrite an existing file.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - (Required) Specify the name of the hardware definition file. The
  file can include the path and file extension. The default file extension of
  .hwdef is used if an extension is not specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example creates the specified hardware definition file:

    write_hwdef  -force C:/Data/ug940/lab1/zynq_design.hdf
