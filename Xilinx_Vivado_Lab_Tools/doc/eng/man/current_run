Description:

  Defines the current synthesis or implementation run, or returns the name of
  the current run. The current run is the one automatically selected when the
  Synthesize or Implement commands are launched.

  You can use the get_runs command to determine the list of defined runs in
  the current design.

Arguments:

  -synthesis - (Optional) Specifies that the current_run command should set
  or return the name of the current synthesis run.

  -implementation - (Optional) Specifies that the current_run command should
  set or return the name of the current implementation run. This is the
  default used when neither -synthesis or -implementation are specified.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <run> - (Optional) Sets the name of the synthesis or implementation run to
  make the current run.

Examples:

  The following example defines the synth_1 run as the current_run:

    current_run synth_1

  Note: The -synthesis and -implementation arguments are not required because
  the name allows the tool to identify the specific run of interest.

  The following command returns the name of the current implementation run:

    current_run -implementation -quiet
