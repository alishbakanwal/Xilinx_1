Description:

  Sets the maximum fanout allowed for the specified <ports>. Limiting the
  maximum fanout allowed affects both placement and routing as well timing
  closure. Specifying fanout is valid for any driver net in the design.

  Note: This command operates silently and does not return direct feedback of
  its operation.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <fanout> - (Optional, Default Value of 0.0) The maximum fanout allowed on
  the specified ports.

  <ports> - A list of port objects to which the maximum fanout specification
  should be applied.

Examples:

  Specify that all input ports should have a maximum fanout of 12 loads:

    set_max_fanout 12 [all_inputs]

  Specify a maximum fanout of 200 for all ports associated with clock objects:

    set_max_fanout 200 [get_ports -of_objects [get_clocks]]
