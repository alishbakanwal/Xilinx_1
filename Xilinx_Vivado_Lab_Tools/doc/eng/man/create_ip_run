Description:

  Defines a synthesis and implementation run for a single IP object as
  specified by the get_ips command, or for the specified IP core file (XCI)
  as specified by the get_files command.

  The IP run is used to generate the synthesis Design Checkpoint file (DCP)
  to support the out-of-context (OOC) IP flow, or to synthesize and implement
  an IP module in the OOC hierarchical design flow.

  Two runs are created, one for synthesis and one for implementation. The
  runs are named after the IP core and the run type: <ip_name> _synth_1 and
  <ip_name> _impl_1.

  The IP source files required to synthesize the run are copied into the IP
  run directory. The attributes of the run can be configured with the use of
  the set_property command.

  This command returns the name of the synthesis run created for the IP module.

Arguments:

  -force - (Optional) Force the creation of an IP run, even if the generated
  output products for the specified IP are all current.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <object> - (Required) An IP object as returned by the get_ips command, or
  an IP file (XCI) as specified by the get_files command.

  Note: Only a single IP may be specified

Examples:

  The following example creates synthesis and implementation runs for the
  specified IP module:

    create_ip_run [get_ips add1]
