Description:

  Create a new hierarchical module in the current IP Integrator subsystem
  design, and move the specified cells into that module.

  You can also optionally move a group of specified cells into the
  hierarchical module. The connections between the specified cells are
  maintained. The connections between the cells being moved are maintained;
  connections between these cells and other cells that are not being moved
  are maintained automatically by IP Integrator adding pins and ports to
  cross the hierarchical boundary.

  You can also move cells into the hierarchical module by using the
  move_bd_cells command after the hierarchical module has been created using
  the create_bd_cells command.

  The command returns the name of the created hierarchical module if
  successful, or an error message if it fails.

Arguments:

  -prefix <arg> - (Optional) A prefix name to apply to any cells that are
  moved into the hierarchical module.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <target_cell_name> - (Required) The name to assign to the hierarchical
  module that is created.

  <cells> - (Required) The list of cells, specified by the get_bd_cells
  command, to move from the current IP subsystem design into the hierarchical
  module.

Example:

  The following example creates a hierarchical block in the current IP
  Integrator subsystem design, and moves the three specified cells into the
  block assigning them a name prefix as indicated:

    group_bd_cells -prefix M1_ module1 [get_bd_cells /microblaze_1_xlconcat] \ 
    [get_bd_cells /microblaze_1_axi_intc] [get_bd_cells /proc_sys_reset_1]
