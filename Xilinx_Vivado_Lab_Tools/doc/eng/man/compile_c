Description:

  In IP cores that are imported from Vivado HLS, the compile_c command
  detects C, C++, and SystemC files and converts those files to RTL for
  synthesis by the Vivado Design Suite.

  This lets you use Vivado HLS to describe IP cores in a high-level language,
  like C or C++ rather than RTL.

  When HLS-based IP cores are generated, they only deliver the C source. When
  the HLS-based IP is synthesized, either in the out-of-context flow, or with
  the top-level design, the compile_c command launches Vivado HLS to convert
  the C source files into RTL, and import the resulting RTL sources back into
  the design prior to synthesis.

  Note: The compile_c command is automatically called by the Vivado Design
  Suite when it encounters IP with C code from the Vivado HLS system. You
  should not need to manually call this command.

Arguments:

  -force - (Optional) Force regeneration of the RTL in the HLS-based IP.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - (Required) Specify the IP objects in the current project to
  convert files from C, C++, or SystemC to RTL code.

Example:

  The following example gets the C-language files from the specified IP
  object and converts them to RTL:

    compile_c [get_ips instance_name]
