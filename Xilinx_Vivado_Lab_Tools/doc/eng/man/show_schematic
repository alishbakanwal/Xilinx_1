Description:

  Create a schematic view containing the specified design objects when the
  tool is invoked in GUI mode.

  The scope of the schematic that is displayed depends on the objects
  specified. A schematic created with cells, shows the specified cells and
  any connections between the cells. A schematic created with pins, shows the
  pin objects, or shows them connected as appropriate if -pin_pairs is
  specified. A schematic created with nets shows the nets, as well as the
  cells and ports connected to the nets.

  To display a schematic with multiple levels of hierarchy, use the
  current_instance command to set the top-level of the hierarchy, or the
  level of interest, and use the -hierarchical option when specifying design
  objects with a get_* command.

  Note: This command is only useful when run in the Vivado IDE. When run in
  Tcl or Batch mode the command simply returns without error or comment.

Arguments:

  -add - (Optional) Add the specified objects to the schematic window.

  -remove - (Optional) Remove the specified objects from the schematic window.

  -regenerate - (Optional) Regenerate the schematic window.

  -pin_pairs - (Optional) When specified with a pair of connected pin
  objects, the schematic shows the pins and the wire between the pins. When
  the -pin_pairs option is not specified, or is specified with disconnected
  pins, the wire is not shown.

  -name <arg> - (Optional) Defines a name for the schematic window opened in
  the GUI. Use this name to add to, remove from, or regenerate the schematic.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - (Required) The netlist objects to display in the schematic
  window.

Examples:

  The following example creates a schematic for the top-level of the design,
  displaying the nets as well as the ports and cells they connect to:

    show_schematic [get_nets]

  The following example sets the level of hierarchy of interest, and creates
  a hierarchical schematic from the current level down:

    current_instance A 
    show_schematic [get_nets -hier]

  The following example creates a schematic window showing the specified
  pins, and the wire connection between them:

    show_schematic -pin_pairs [get_pins {data0_i/O data_reg/D}]
