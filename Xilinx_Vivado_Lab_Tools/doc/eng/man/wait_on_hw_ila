Description:

  Suspend Tcl script or Tcl command processing until the ILA debug core
  memory is filled by captured data samples.

  This command is used after the run_hw_ila command to pause Tcl processing
  to wait for the data buffers to fill up. When the wait_on_hw_ila command
  returns, the Tcl command or script processing can continue.

  With the ILA debug core memory filed with sample data, when Tcl processing
  resumes, you can upload the captured data samples into an ILA debug core
  data object, or hw_ila_data object. Use the upload_ila_data command to
  perform this action.

  This command operates silently, returning nothing if successful, or
  returning an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -timeout <arg> - (Optional) Wait for this period of time for all data on
  the ILA debug cores to be captured. If the timeout interval is reached, the
  wait command is terminated.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_ilas> - (Optional) Specify one or more hw_ila objects to wait on. The
  hw_ila objects must be specified as an object as returned by the
  get_hw_ilas or current_hw_ila commands. If the hardware ILA is not
  specified, the current_hw_ila will be run.

Example:

  The following example waits for all data on the current hardware ILA debug
  core to be captured:

    
    run_hw_ila hw_ila_1 -trigger_now 1 
    INFO: [Labtools 27-1964] The ILA core `hw_ila_1` trigger was armed

    wait_on_hw_ila hw_ila_1 
    display_hw_ila_data [upload_hw_ila_data hw_ila_1] 
    INFO: [Labtools 27-1966] The ILA core `hw_ila_1` triggered
