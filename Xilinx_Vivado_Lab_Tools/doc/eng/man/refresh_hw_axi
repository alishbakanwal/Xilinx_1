Description:

  Refresh the STATUS properties of the hw_axi object with the values from the
  current hw_device.

  The refresh command takes the values from the status registers of the JTAG
  to AXI MASTER on the hardware device, and populates them into the
  appropriate properties of the hw_axi object in the hardware manager.

  Refresh the STATUS properties of the specified hw_axi objects. THE STATUS
  properties include: STATUS.AXI_READ_BUSY, STATUS.AXI_READ_DONE,
  STATUS.AXI_WRITE_BUSY, STATUS.AXI_WRITE_DONE, STATUS.BRESP, and
  STATUS.RRESP.

  This command updates the properties on the hw_axi object, but otherwise
  returns nothing if successful. The command returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_axis> - (Required) The hw_axi objects to refresh. The hw_axi must be
  specified as an object returned by the get_hw_axis command.

Example:

  The following example refreshes the STATUS properties of the hw_axi objects:

    refresh_hw_axi [get_hw_axis]
