Description:

  Report the transformed primitives in the current design.

  As part of the process of opening the Synthesized design, and loading it
  into memory, the tool will transform legacy netlist primitives to the
  supported subset of Unisim primitives.

  As a default this report will be written to the standard output. However,
  the report can also be written to a file or returned to a Tcl string
  variable for further processing.


Arguments:

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the transformed primitives report into the
  specified file. The specified file will be overwritten if one already
  exists, unless -append is also specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - Append the output of the command to the specified file rather
  than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string. The Tcl
  string can be captured by a variable definition and parsed or otherwise
  processed.

  Note: This argument cannot be used with the -file option.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.


Examples:

  The following example reports the transformed primitives in the current
  design, and returns the result to the specified Tcl variable:

    set transPrim [ report_transformed_primitives -return_string ]
