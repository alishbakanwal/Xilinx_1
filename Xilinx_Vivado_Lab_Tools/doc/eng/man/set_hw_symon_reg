Description:

  Set the status register of the system monitor to the hex value specified.
  This command identifies a register on the system monitor on the current
  device through its hex address value, and sets the specified hex data value
  into that register.

  The System Monitor (SYSMON) Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) is used to
  measure die temperature and voltage on the hw_device. The Sysmon monitors
  the physical environment via on-chip temperature and supply sensors. The
  ADC can access up to 17 external analog input channels.

  Data for the system monitor is stored in dedicated registers, called status
  registers, accessible through the get_hw_sysmon_reg and set_hw_sysmon_reg
  commands. Refer to the Register Interface in UltraScale Architecture System
  Monitor User Guide (UG580), or 7 Series FPGAs and Zynq-7000 All
  Programmable SoC XADC Dual 12-Bit 1 MSPS Analog-to-Digital Converter User
  Guide (UG480) for more information on the addresses of specific system
  monitor registers.

  Although you can use the set_hw_sysmon_reg command to put the specified hex
  data value into the specific registers of a system monitor, you can put all
  updated property values of the hw_sysmon object onto the current hardware
  device using the commit_hw_sysmon command.

  This command returns the hex value of the hw_sysmon_reg object on the
  specified hw_sysmons at the specified address, or returns an error if it
  fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_sysmon> - (Optional) Specify the hw_sysmon object to set the registers
  of. The hw_sysmon object must be specified as an object returned by the
  get_hw_sysmon command.

  <hexaddress> - (Optional) Specify the hex address of the status register on
  the system monitor to set the value of.

  <hexdata> - (Optional) Specify the data, as a hex value, to populate into
  the the register defined by the hex address.

Example:

  The following example sets the specified hex data value into the register
  at the hex address of the system monitor on the current hardware device:

    set_hw_sysmon_reg [current_hw_device] 00 9D28
