Description:

  This command is intended for use with the graphical user interface of the
  Vivado Design Suite logic analyzer feature. It displays the specified ILA
  debug core data object in a wave config window of the Vivado logic
  analyzer.

  The ILA debug sample data is acquired from a running device using the
  upload_hw_ila_data command. This creates a hw_ila_data object that can be
  written to a file on disk using the write_hw_ila_data command. This command
  reads that ILA data file.

  The display characteristics of the ILA debug core in the waveform window
  are determined by the Wave Config file. The Wave Config file contains just
  the list of wave objects (signals, dividers, groups, virtual buses) to
  display, and their display properties, plus markers.

  A wave configuration object is created in the Vivado logic analyzer with
  the create_wave_config command. A Wave Config file is written to disk by
  the use of the save_wave_config command, and can be opened with the
  open_wave_config command.

  The open_wave_config command opens a Wave Config file and maps it to the
  data source in the current simulation.

Arguments:

  -wcfg <arg> - (Optional) View the ILA data using the specified Wave Config
  file, created using the save_wave_config command. If the -wcfg option is
  not specified, the ILA data will display in a default wave configuration as
  determined by the Vivado logic analyzer.

  -reset - (Optional) Reset the waveform window to the default configuration
  and display the specified ILA data.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_ila_data> - (Optional) Specify one or more hw_ila_data objects to
  display. The hw_ila_data must be specified as an object as returned by the
  get_hw_ila_datas or current_hw_ila_data commands. If the hardware ILA data
  is not specified, the current_hw_ila_data object will be displayed.

Example:

  The following example reads a hw_ila_data file, and displays the resulting
  hw_ila_data object in the waveform window of the Vivado logic analyzer:

    read_hw_ila_data C:/hw_ila_file.ila 
    display_hw_ila_data [get_hw_ila_datas hw_ila_file]
