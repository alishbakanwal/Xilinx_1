Description:

  Gets a list of files in the current project that match a specified search
  pattern. The default command gets a list of all files in the project.

  The get_files command returns a machine readable list of files in the
  project, in a design, or in a sub-design such as an IP core or block
  design. You can filter the results returned by get_files using one of the
  command arguments such as -of_objects, -compile_order, -used_in, and
  -filter.

  The -compile_order and -used_in options must be used together to return a
  list of files from the sources or constraints filesets used in synthesis,
  simulation, OR implementation, sorted according to the order of evaluation
  by the Vivado tools. The -compile_order and -used_in options use complex
  file ordering rules that can change based on header files, include files,
  or other language options. You can also filter files returned by get_files
  according to the USED_IN property, using the -filter option instead of the
  -used_in option.

  You can use the report_compile_order command to generate a report of all
  files in the sources or constraints filesets, used in synthesis,
  simulation, AND implementation, sorted into different sections.

  Note: To improve memory and performance, the get_* commands return a
  container list of a single type of objects (e.g. cells, nets, pins, or
  ports). You can add new objects to the list (using lappend for instance),
  but you can only add the same type of object that is currently in the list.
  Adding a different type of object, or string, to the list is not permitted
  and will result in a Tcl error.

Arguments:

  -regexp - (Optional) Specifies that the search <patterns> are written as
  regular expressions. Both search <patterns> and -filter expressions must be
  written as regular expressions when this argument is used. Xilinx regular
  expression Tcl commands are always anchored to the start of the search
  string. You can add ".*" to the beginning or end of a search string to
  widen the search to include a substring. See
  http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html for help with regular expression
  syntax.

  Note: The Tcl built-in command regexp is not anchored, and works as a
  standard Tcl command. For more information refer to
  http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/regexp.htm.

  -nocase - (Optional) Perform case-insensitive matching when a pattern has
  been specified. This argument applies to the use of -regexp only.

  -filter <args> - (Optional) Filter the results list with the specified
  expression. The -filter argument filters the list of objects returned by
  get_files based on property values on the files. You can find the
  properties on an object with the report_property or list_property commands.
  Any property/value pair can be used as a filter. In the case of the "file"
  object, "FILE_TYPE", and "IS_ENABLED" are some of the properties that can
  be used to filter results.

  The filter search pattern should be quoted to avoid having to escape
  special characters that may be found in net, pin, or cell names, or other
  properties. String matching is case-sensitive and is always anchored to the
  start and to the end of the search string. The wildcard "*" character can
  be used at the beginning or at the end of a search string to widen the
  search to include a substring of the property value.

  Note: The filter returns an object if a specified property exists on the
  object, and the specified pattern matches the property value on the object.
  In the case of the "*" wildcard character, this will match a property with
  a defined value of "".

  For string comparison, the specific operators that can be used in filter
  expressions are "equal" (==), "not-equal" (!=), "match" (=~), and
  "not-match" (!~). Numeric comparison operators <, >, <=, and >= can also be
  used. Multiple filter expressions can be joined by AND and OR (&& and ||).
  The following gets input pins that do NOT contain the "RESET" substring
  within their name:

    get_pins * -filter {DIRECTION == IN && NAME !~ "*RESET*"}

  Boolean (bool) type properties can be directly evaluated in filter
  expressions as true or not true:

    -filter {IS_PRIMITIVE && !IS_LOC_FIXED}

  -of_objects <args> - (Optional) Get the files that are associated with the
  specified file, fileset, IP, or reconfigmodule objects. The default is to
  search all filesets. When -compile_order and -used_in are specified, the
  -of_objects switch will only accept a single fileset, or a single
  sub-design such as an IP core, Block Design, or DSP design. A sub-design is
  also known as a composite file.

  Note: The -of_objects option requires objects to be specified using the
  get_* commands, such as get_cells or get_pins, rather than specifying
  objects by name. In addition, -of_objects cannot be used with a search
  <pattern>.

  -compile_order [ sources | constraints ] - (Optional) Returns the source
  design files, or the constraint files sorted according to the order of
  compilation by the Vivado Design Suite.

  Note: This option must be used with the -used_in option. When specified,
  the -of_objects switch will only accept a single fileset or sub-design.

  -used_in <arg> - (Optional) Accepts one of the enumerated values of the
  USED_IN property for files, and returns files matching the specified value.
  Valid values for this option include the following: synthesis, simulation,
  or implementation. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite Properties Reference
  Guide (UG912) for information on the USED_IN property and its supported
  values.

  Note: This option must be used with the -compile_order option. When
  specified, the -of_objects switch will only accept a single fileset or
  sub-design.

  -all - (Optional) Returns all of the files in the design, including
  internal files in support of IP and other objects.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <patterns> - (Optional) Match files against the specified patterns. The
  default pattern is the wildcard `*` which gets all files in the project or
  of_objects. More than one pattern can be specified to find multiple files
  based on different search criteria.

Examples:

  The following example returns the VHDL files in the design that are used in
  simulation:

    get_files -filter {FILE_TYPE == VHDL && USED_IN =~ simulation*}

  This example returns the design source files that are used in simulation:

    get_files -compile_order sources -used_in simulation

  This example gets a list of files associated with the specified IP core
  composite file (ip.xci), from the sources_1 fileset that are used in
  synthesis:

    get_files -compile_order sources -used_in synthesis -of [get_files ip.xci]

  The following example gets a list of the files found in the sources_1 and
  constrs_1 filesets:

    get_files -of [get_filesets {sources_1 constrs_1}]

  Note: If there are no files matching the pattern you will get a warning.
