Description:

  Defines the current design or returns the name of the current design in the
  active project.

  The current design and current instance are the target of most Tcl
  commands, design edits and constraint changes made in the tool. The current
  instance can be defined using the current_instance command.

  You can use the get_designs command to get a list of open designs in the
  active project, and use the get_projects command to get a list of open
  projects.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <design> - (Optional) The name of design to set as the current design. If a
  <design> is not specified, the command returns the current design of the
  active project.

Examples:

  The following example sets the design rtl_1 as the current design:

    current_design rtl_1
