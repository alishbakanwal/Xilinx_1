Description:

  Defines a synthesis or implementation run. The attributes of the run can be
  configured with the use of the set_property command.

Arguments:

  -constrset <arg> - (Optional) The constraint set to use for the synthesis
  or implementation run.

  -parent_run <arg> - The run that defines the netlist for the current run.
  For netlist-based projects the parent_run argument is not required. For an
  RTL sources project, the parent_run must be specified for implementation
  runs, but is not required for synthesis runs. For the Partial
  Reconfiguration flow the parent_run can describe the synthesis run, an
  implementation run, or the PR configuration. Refer to the Vivado Design
  Suite User Guide: Partial Reconfiguration (UG909) for more information.

  -part <partName> - (Optional) The Xilinx part to be used for the run. If
  the -part option is not specified, the default part defined for the project
  will be assigned as the part to use.

  -flow <arg> - (Required) The tool flow and release version for the
  synthesis tool {Vivado Synthesis 2012} or the implementation tool {Vivado
  Implementation 2012}.

  -strategy <arg> - (Optional) The strategy to employ for the synthesis or
  implementation run. There are many different strategies to choose from
  within the tool, including custom strategies you can define. Refer to the
  appropriate user guide for a discussion of the available synthesis and
  implementation strategies. If the strategy argument is not specified,
  "Synthesis Defaults" or "Implementation Defaults" will be used as
  appropriate.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) The name of the synthesis or implementation run to be
  created.

Examples:

  The following example creates a run named synth_1 referencing the Vivado
  synthesis tool flow:

    create_run -flow {Vivado Synthesis 2013} synth_1

  Note: The defaults of sources_1, constrs_1, and the default part for the
  project will be used in the synthesis run. In addition, since this is a
  synthesis run, the -parent_run argument is not required.

  The following example creates an implementation run based on the Vivado
  Implementation 2013 tool flow, and attaches it to the synth_1 synthesis run
  previously created:

    create_run impl_2 -parent_run synth_1 -flow {Vivado Implementation 2013}

  Note: The -parent_run argument is required in this example because it is an
  implementation of synthesized RTL sources.
