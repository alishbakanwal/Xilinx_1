Description:

  Rename the reference name of a single non-primitive cell, or apply a
  reference prefix to all non-primitive cells in the current synthesized or
  implemented design.

  This command provides a mechanism to change the non-primitive reference
  names in the current design so that they do not collide with the reference
  names in another design. This lets two modules or designs be synthesized or
  simulated together, while avoiding any name collisions between the two
  designs.

  This command returns nothing when renaming the reference a single cell, and
  returns the number of cells renamed when used with -prefix_all. If the
  command fails, an error is returned.

Arguments:

  -ref <arg> - (Optional) Specify the current reference name of a
  non-primitive cell.

  -to <arg> - (Optional) Change the reference name to the specified value.

  -prefix_all <arg> - (Optional) Apply the specified prefix to the reference
  names of all non-primitive cells in the current design, except the top
  module.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example changes the specified reference name to the value
  indicated:

    rename_ref -ref usbf_top -to MOD1_usbf_top

  The following example applies the specified reference name prefix to all
  non-primitive cells in the current design:

    rename_ref -prefix_all MOD1_
