Description:

  Disconnect a single net in the IP Integrator subsystem design from the
  specified objects.

  This command lets you disconnect the specified nets from pins or ports in
  the IP subsystem design, without deleting the whole net. To delete the
  whole net, you should use the delete_bd_objs command.

  This command returns TCL_OK if successful, or TCL_ERROR if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <net> - (Required) Specifies a single net in the IP subsystem design to
  disconnect from the specified objects. The net can be specified by name, or
  as a single object returned by the get_bd_nets command.

  <objects> - (Required) The list of pin or port objects to disconnect the
  net from. The pins and ports must be specified as design objects returned
  by the get_bd_pins or get_bd_ports commands. They cannot simply be
  referenced by name.

Example:

  The following example disconnects the net, here specified by name, from the
  specified pin objects:

    disconnect_bd_net /vidout1_locked [get_bd_pins {vidOut1/locked newMod1/t1}]
