Description:

  Clear the specified timing results from the named result set. Both the type
  of the timing report, and the name of the timing report must be specified,
  or the command will fail.

Arguments:

  -type <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the type of timing results to be
  cleared. The available types are:

   *  check_timing - Delete the named check_timing report.

   *  clock_interaction - Delete the named report_clock_interaction report.

   *  clock_domain_crossing - Delete the named CDC report.

   *  config_timing - Delete the current Timing COnfig report.

   *  datasheet - Delete the named report_datasheet report.

   *  pulse_width - Delete the named report_pulse_width report.

   *  slack_histogram - Delete the named create_slack_histogram report.

   *  timing_path - Delete the named report_timing report.

   *  timing_summary - Delete the named report_timing_summary report.

  Note: The default -type is timing_path, to delete reports generated by the
  report_timing command.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) Specifies the name of the timing results to be cleared.

Examples:

  The following example clears the specified results set from memory:

    delete_timing_results -type clock_interaction clkNets
