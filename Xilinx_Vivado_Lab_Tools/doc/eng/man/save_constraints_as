Description:

  Copies the active constraints set to create a new constraints set, with
  local copies of any constraints files that are part of the constraints set.
  You can also specify a new constraints file to use as the target for the
  copied constraints set.

  Use this command to save changes to the constraints in a design without
  affecting the current constraints files. This allows you to do some
  "what-if" type development of design constraints.

  Note: The new constraint set created by the save_constraints_as command
  will not be active in the design, although it will be referenced by the
  design. To make the constraints set active you must set the constrset
  property to point to the new constraints set for specific runs. See the
  example below.

Arguments:

  -dir <arg> - (Optional) The directory into which constraints files are
  saved. If the directory is not specified, the new constraints set is
  located in the project sources directory. The constraints files from the
  active constraints set are copied into the specified directory.

  -target_constrs_file <arg> - (Optional) Specifies a new target constraints
  file for the new constraints fileset. If a path is not specified as part of
  the file name, the file will be created in the fileset directory.

  Note: You must specify the .xdc file extension, or the command will report
  a warning that the filetype is invalid, and cannot be set to the target
  constraint set. In this case, the existing target constraints file will be
  used as the target.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) The name of the constraints set to write.

Examples:

  The following example saves the active constraints set into a new
  constraints set called constrs_2, and copies any constraints files into the
  specified directory, as well as creating a new target constraints file for
  the constraints set:

    save_constraints_as -dir C:/Data/con1 \ 
       -target_constrs_file rev1.xdc constrs_2

  The following example saves the active constraints set as a new constraints
  set called newCon2, and copies any constraint files into the newCon2
  constraint directory under project sources. The constrset property for the
  specified synthesis and implementation runs are then set to point to the
  new constraints set:

    save_constraints_as newCon2 
    set_property CONSTRSET newCon2 [get_runs synth_1] 
    set_property CONSTRSET newCon2 [get_runs impl_1]

  Note: The constraints set is not active in the design until it has been set
  to active for the current runs.
