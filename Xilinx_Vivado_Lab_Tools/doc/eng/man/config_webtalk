Description:

  WebTalk is a secure design data collection feature of Xilinx software that
  helps Xilinx understand how you are using Xilinx devices, software, and
  Intellectual Property (IP).

  This command returns the current state of the WebTalk feature for the
  current user and software installation. You can also enable or disable
  WebTalk to send software, IP and device usage statistics to Xilinx. No data
  is sent if you disable WebTalk, except for the use of the WebPACK license
  to generate a bitstream.

  Participation in WebTalk is voluntary, except for the use of the WebPACK
  license. WebTalk data transmission is mandatory, and is always enabled for
  WebPACK users. WebTalk ignores user and install preference when a bitstream
  is generated using the WebPACK license.

  Note: If a design is using a device contained in WebPACK and a WebPACK
  license is available, the WebPACK license will be used. To change this,
  please see answer record 34746.

Arguments:

  -info - (Optional) Returns information about the current Webtalk
  configuration. The state of WebTalk is dependent on both the user and
  install setting. If either of these settings is disabled, then WebTalk is
  disabled.

  -user arg - (Optional) Enables or disables WebTalk for the current user.

  -install - (Optional) Enables or disables WebTalk for the current software
  installation.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example returns the current state of the WebTalk configuration:

    
    config_webtalk -info 
    INFO: [Coretcl-120] Webtalk has been disabled by the current user. 
    INFO: [Coretcl-123] Webtalk has been enabled for the current installation. 
    INFO: [Coretcl-110] This combination of user/install settings means that 
    WebTalk is currently disabled.

  The following example enables WebTalk for the current user:

    
    config_webtalk -user on
