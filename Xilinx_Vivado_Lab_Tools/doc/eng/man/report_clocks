Description:

  Returns a table showing all the clocks in a design, including propagated
  clocks, generated and auto-generated clocks, virtual clocks, and inverted
  clocks in the current synthesized or implemented design. More detailed
  information about each clock net can be obtained with the
  report_clock_utilization command.

  Note: By default the report is written to the Tcl console or STD output.
  However, the results can also be written to a file or returned as a string
  if desired.

Arguments:

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file. The
  specified file will be overwritten if one already exists, unless -append is
  also specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string rather than
  to the standard output. The Tcl string can be captured by a variable
  definition and parsed or otherwise processed.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <clocks> - (Optional) The clocks to match against the specified patterns.
  The default pattern is the wildcard `*` which returns all clocks in the
  design. More than one pattern can be specified to find multiple clocks
  based on different search criteria.

Examples:

  The following example returns the name, period, waveform, and sources of
  the clocks in the current design:

    report_clocks -file C:/Data/FPGA_Design/clock_out.txt

  The following example reports the clocks in the design with "Clock" in the
  name:

    report_clocks *Clock*
