Description:

  Reset the current simulation to its starting condition, by cleaning out the
  various output files created during compilation and simulation for the
  specified simulation fileset.

  Note: Local files will be removed from the project simulation folders
  without warning.

  The command returns nothing if successful, or an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -mode [ behavioral | post-synthesis | post-implementation ] - (Optional)
  Specify the simulation mode to reset. Valid values include behavioral
  simulation, post-synthesis, or post implementation simulation. The default
  mode is behavioral.

  -type [ functional | timing ] - (Optional) Cannot be used with -mode
  behavioral. Specifies functional simulation of just the netlist, or timing
  simulation of the netlist and SDF file. Post-synthesis timing simulation
  uses SDF component delays from the synth_design command.
  Post-implementation timing simulation uses SDF delays from the place_design
  and route_design commands.

  Note: Do not use -type with -mode behavioral, or the tool will return an
  error.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <simset> - (Optional) Specify a simulation fileset to remove. The default
  simset is sim_1.

Examples:

  The following example resets the post-synthesis timing simulation by
  removing files for the sim_2 simset:

    reset_simulation -mode post-synthesis -type timing sim_2
