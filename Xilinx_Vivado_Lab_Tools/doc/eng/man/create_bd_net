Description:

  Create a new net in the current IP Integrator subsystem design.

  This command returns the newly created net object, or returns an error if
  failed.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) The names of nets to create. Net names can be specified
  from the top-level, as name only (net1), or can be specified within the
  design hierarchy by specifying the hierarchical net name
  (cell1/cellA/net1).

Example:

  The following example creates a new net:

    create_bd_net net1
