Description:

  Parses Verilog, SystemVerilog, and VHDL source files and generates syntax
  warnings and error messages for the design.

  Note: The syntax is also checked automatically as the file is edited in the
  Vivado text editor, or when the file is saved.

  This command returns warnings or errors related to the files it examines,
  or returns nothing if no problems are found.

Arguments:

  -fileset <arg> - (Optional) Check the syntax of files in the specified
  fileset.

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string rather than
  to the standard output. The Tcl string can be captured by a variable
  definition and parsed or otherwise processed.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example checks the syntax of files in the simulation fileset:

    check_syntax -fileset sim_1
