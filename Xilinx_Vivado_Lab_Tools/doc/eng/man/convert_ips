Description:

  This command converts existing IP into core container format, or reverts
  core container IP into the expanded non-core container format.

  The core container format for IP is a compressed zip file that reduces the
  file structure in the design, and increases tool performance.

  By default, the Vivado tool adds IP from the Xilinx IP catalog into a
  design using the core container format. However, the convert _ips command
  lets you convert IP in existing designs to take advantage of the core
  container format. In addition, the convert_ips command also lets you revert
  the compressed core container format into the expanded non-core container
  format.

  Note: If neither -to_core_container or -from_core_container options are
  specified then the convert_ips command will convert the IP from its current
  format into the opposite form. Any core container IP will be converted to
  non-core container format, and any non-core container IP will be converted
  to core container format.

  IP that is user-managed, cannot be converted from its current format. IP
  that is locked requires the use of the -force option to convert. Refer to
  the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Designing with IP (UG896) for more
  information on editing IP and the IS_LOCKED and IS_MANAGED properties.

  This command returns a transcript of its actions, or returns an error if it
  fails.

Arguments:

  -force - (Optional) Force the conversion of IP that are currently locked
  (IS_LOCKED).

  -to_core_container - (Optional) Convert existing expanded form IP into the
  core container format. Any IP specified that are already in core container
  format will simply be ignored.

  -from_core_container - (Optional) Convert IP currently in the core
  container format into the expanded form of the non-core container format.
  Any IP specified that are already in non-core container format will simply
  be ignored.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - (Required) Specify the IP objects or IP files to convert. IP
  files can be specified using the get_files command, or IP objects can be
  specified with get_ips.

Examples:

  The following example converts all IP in the current project into core
  container format:

    
    convert_ips -to_core_container [get_ips]

  Note: Any IP already in the core container format will be skipped.

  The following example converts the specified IP file to core container
  format:

    convert_ips -to_core_container \ 
    [get_files  C:/Data/wave1/wave1.srcs/sources_1/ip/char_fifo/char_fifo.xci]

  The following example toggles the current format of all IP in the design,
  switching from core container to non-core container, and from non-core
  container to core container:

    convert_ips [get_ips]
