Description:

  Return the current simulation to its initial state, as if the design was
  reloaded, resetting the current simulation time to 0.

  The restart command retains breakpoints, Tcl forces, and settings in the
  waveform configuration window, but resets all simulation values, and clears
  all other Tcl commands.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example restarts the current simulation:
