Description:

  Move the connections currently assigned to one IP Integrator cell to
  another IP Integrator cell in the current design. This is intended to help
  you quickly replace one cell with another by moving connections from the
  source cell to the target cell.

  The current, or existing cell, will be relocated from its current position
  in the block design, and the new replacing cell will be placed at that
  location. Connections to the pins and interface pins on the cell are
  preserved where possible, and result in a Critical Warning when connections
  must be removed.

  This command returns TCL_OK if successful, or returns TCL_ERROR if it fails.

Arguments:

  -preserve_name - (Optional) Apply the name of the current cell to the new
  cell that is replacing it. The existing cell will be renamed as <instance>
  _old.

  -preserve_configuration - (Optional) Apply the configuration settings of
  the current cell to the new cell that is replacing it.

  Note: Any configuration options on the original cell that cannot be applied
  to the new cell will be reported as a warning, and then skipped.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <cell1> - (Required) The IP Integrator cell to remove connections from and
  to replace with a new cell. The cell can be specified either by name, or as
  a bd_cell object returned by the get_bd_cells command.

  Note: The cell is not removed from the IP Integrator subsystem design, but
  is relocated to make room for the new cell.

  <cell2> - The IP Integrator cell that replaces the existing cell (<cell1> )
  and that existing connections are applied to. The cell can be specified
  either by name, or as a bd_cell object returned by the get_bd_cells
  command.

Example:

  The following example moves the connections from the specified cell,
  lmb_v10_1, to pins and interface pins of the same name on another cell,
  lmb_bram_cntlr_1:

    
    replace_bd_cell [get_bd_cells /lmb_v10_1] [get_bd_cells \ 
       /lmb_bram_if_cntlr_1] 
    CRITICAL WARNING: [BD 41-1164] The interface pin `LMB_Sl_0` with  
    bus definition `xilinx.com:interface:lmb:1.0` is not found on the 
    cell `/lmb_bram_if_cntlr_1`. Its connection to the interface  
    net `Conn` has been removed.  
    CRITICAL WARNING: [BD 41-1166] The pin `SYS_Rst` is not found 
    on the cell `/lmb_bram_if_cntlr_1`. Its connection to the net  
    `sys_rst_1` has been removed. 
    0

  Note: Critical Warnings are returned when pin mismatches necessitate the
  removal of existing connections.
