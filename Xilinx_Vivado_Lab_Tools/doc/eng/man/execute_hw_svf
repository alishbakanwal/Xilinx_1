Description:

  The Vivado hardware manager supports programming of hardware devices
  through the use of Serial Vector Format (SVF) files. SVF files are ASCII
  files that contain both programming instructions and configuration data.
  These files are used by ATE machines and embedded controllers to perform
  boundary-scan operations. The SVF file is an ASCII files that captures the
  JTAG commands needed to program the bitstream directly into a Xilinx
  device, or indirectly into a flash memory device. The SVF file can be
  written using the write_hw_svf command, or used to program a device through
  the execute_hw_svf command. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide:
  Programming and Debugging (UG908) for more information.

  The execute_hw_svf command converts the SVF commands into Vivado TCL
  commands and executes them on the specified target. This process could take
  some time depending on how big the SVF file is. The command requires an
  open, current hw_target object, with a JTAG chain that matches the device
  chain specified in the SVF file.

  Note: The execute_hw_svf command is not a general purpose SVF reader, and
  should only be used to read and execute SVF files written by the Vivado
  tools.

  This command returns a transcript of its process, or returns an error if it
  fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from the execute_hw_svf command. Use this option when you are
  debugging problems related to executing the SVF file, as this option will
  display all of the psuedo-SVF commands that the Vivado tool is running
  while executing the file.

  <file_name> - Specifies the SVF file name to execute.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the tool will
  search for the specified file in the current working directory and then in
  the directory from which the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example executes the specified SVF command file in verbose
  mode to display all of the commands being run:

    open_hw_target {houdini26:3121/xilinx_tcf/Digilent/210203327996A} 
    execute_hw_svf -verbose C:/Data/k7_design.svf
