Description:

  Create an Embedded Processor source for use in the current project, and add
  it to the source files.

  This command will launch the Xilinx Platform Studio (XPS) to let you design
  the hardware portion of the embedded processor system. In XPS you can
  define and configure the microprocessor, peripherals, and the
  interconnection of these components. After you exit XPS, the created files
  for the Embedded Processor sub-design will be written to the local project
  directory (<project_name>.srcs/sources_1/edk/<name> ), and added to the
  source files.

  For more information on using specific features of XPS refer to EDK
  Concepts, Tools, and Techniques (UG683).

  You can also add existing Xilinx Microprocessor Project (.xmp) files from
  XPS in the current project using the add_files command.

  The command returns the name of the Embedded Processor sub-design created.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) The name of the Embedded Processor sub-design to create
  and add to the current project.

Examples:

  The following example launches XPS to define and configure the specified
  Embedded Processor sub-design:

    create_xps xpsTest1
