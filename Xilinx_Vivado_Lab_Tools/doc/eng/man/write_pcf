Description:

  Writes a PCF file from the current constraints in the design. A PCF file is
  an ASCII file with physical constraints defined by MAP, followed by
  physical constraints defined by the user. The MAP section is rewritten
  during every implementation pass. The order of constraints ensures that
  user constraints are read last, and will override MAP constraints.

  The PCF file is an optional input to PAR, the FPGA Editor, TRACE, NetGen,
  and BitGen.

Arguments:

  -force - Overwrite the PCF file if it already exists.

  <file> - The filename of the PCF file to write.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example creates a PCF file called designOut.pcf:

    write_pcf designOut.pcf
