  this command to update a local file with the contents of its original
  remote file, or replace it with the contents of a different remote file.

Arguments:

  -file <arg> - The local project file to be updated.

  replace the local file. The remote file is copied into the local project
  directory structure and added to the project, replacing the specified file.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example updates the specified file with the remote file:

    update_file -file C:/Data/design1.v -remote_file C:/Source/design1.v

  Note: No warnings will be issued for newer local files that will be
  overwritten.
