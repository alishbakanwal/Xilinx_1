Description:

  Use this command to copy IP Integrator objects from one open subsystem
  design to a second subsystem design. The selected objects can be copied
  into the top-level of the current subsystem design, or into an existing
  hierarchical module.

  Because get_bd_cells, and other commands like it, operate on the current
  subsystem design, you must store the objects to be copied in a Tcl
  variable, as shown in the example below. Set the current subsystem design
  to the source design, select the group of objects to be copied, and store
  them in a Tcl variable. Then change the current_bd_design to the target
  design, and copy the selected objects. In this case, the -from_design
  option must be used.

  You can also use this command to copy objects from one level of hierarchy
  in the current subsystem design to another. In this case, the -from_design
  argument does not need to be specified.

  This command returns 0 if successful, and returns an error if it failed.

Arguments:

  -prefix <arg> - (Optional) A prefix name to apply to any cells that are
  copied into the hierarchical module.

  -from_design <arg> - (Optional) The name of the IP Integrator subsystem
  design where the specified objects are located. The design must be open in
  IP Integrator. If -from_design is not specified, the objects are located in
  the current design, as determined by the current_bd_design command.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <parent_cell> - (Required) The name of the hierarchical module to copy the
  specified objects into. You can specify "/" for the top-level of the
  current subsystem design.

  <objects> - (Required) The list of cells and nets specified by the
  get_bd_cells and get_bd_nets commands, to copy into the specified
  <parent_cell>.

Example:

  The following example sets the current subsystem design, selects a group of
  objects, and stores them in a Tcl variable. The current subsystem design is
  then changed, and the selected objects are copied into the top-level of the
  current design:

    current_bd_design myDesign 
    myDesign 
    set copyObjs [get_bd_cells {vidOut_1 bridge_1}] 
    /vidOut_1 /bridge_1 
    current_bd_design design_1 
    design_1 
    copy_bd_objs -from_design myDesign / $copyObjs 
    0

  Note: Because the get_bd_cells command only returns cells from the current
  subsystem design, the Tcl variable is used to store those objects prior to
  switching to the target design with current_bd_design.
