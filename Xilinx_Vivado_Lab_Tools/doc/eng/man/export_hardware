Description:

  Specify the embedded processor block design files to export to SDK.

  Export the Embedded Processor system hardware platform from an IP
  Integrator block design, for use by the Software Development Kit (SDK), to
  support the design of software for the embedded processor sources in your
  project.

  The export_hardware command writes an XML file that contains the hardware
  description of the IP Integrator block design for use in SDK, including
  what IP cores are used, and where they reside in the memory map. It also
  exports the bitstream (.bit) and block memory map (.bmm) file to enable
  device programming and debug in SDK. The output of the command can be used
  to invoke SDK with the launch_sdk command.

  Note: The export_hardware command requires the IP Integrator block design
  to be integrated into a top-level design using an HDL wrapper or
  instantiation template. In some cases it also requires the prior generation
  of output products for the block design, as created by the generate_target
  command. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Designing IP
  Subsystems Using IP Integrator (UG994) for more information on working with
  block designs.

  The tool will export the hardware description to the <project_name>
  .sdk/SDK/SDK_Export/hw directory in the current project, writing a file
  named after the IP Integrator block design. However, the output of the
  export_hardware command can be redirected to a user-defined directory with
  the -dir option.

  This command returns the name of the SDK export file, or returns an error
  if it fails.

Arguments:

  -bitstream - (Optional) Export the bitstream and BMM model data for the
  Embedded Processor, in addition to the hardware specification file.

  Note: When this option is used, the tool will return an error if the
  bitstream file does not exist.

  -dir <arg> - (Optional) Specify the directory to write exported files to.
  By default the hardware files will be written to the local project
  directory, under <project_name> .sdk/SDK/SDK_Export/hw.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <files> - (Required) A files object that contains the list of Block Design
  files (.bd) to export.

  Note: Use get_files to specify a files object, rather than specifying a
  file name.

  <run> - (Optional) Specify an implementation run to export when the project
  contains multiple runs.

Examples:

  The following example exports the Embedded Processor design to the standard
  SDK export directory, and includes the Bitstream and BMM model data:

    export_hardware -bitstream [get_files *.bd]
