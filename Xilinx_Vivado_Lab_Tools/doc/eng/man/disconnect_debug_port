Description:

  Disconnect signals from the debug ports.

  Signals from the Netlist Design are connected to ports of a ILA debug core
  using the connect_debug_port command.

  A port can also be deleted from the debug core rather than simply
  disconnected by using the delete_debug_port command.

  If you need to determine the specific name of a port on a debug core, use
  the get_debug_ports command to list all ports on a core. You can also use
  the report_debug_core command to list all of the cores in the projects, and
  their specific parameters.

Arguments:

  -channel_index <value> - (Optional) The channel index of the port to
  disconnect.

  Note: The entire port is disconnected if channel_index is not specified.

  <port> - (Required) The name of the port on the debug core to disconnect.
  The port name must be specified as core_name/port_name. See the examples
  below.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example disconnects only the specified channel index from the
  PROBE1 port of myCore:

    disconnect_debug_port -channel_index 2 myCore/PROBE1

  If you do not specify the channel_index, all of the channels of the
  specified port will be disconnected, as in the following example:

    disconnect_debug_port myCore/PROBE1
