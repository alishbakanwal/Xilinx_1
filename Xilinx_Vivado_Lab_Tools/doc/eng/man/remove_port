Description:

  Removes the specified ports or buses.

  To remove a bus port, you must specify the primary port name, and not
  specify a bus index. This ensures that the entire bus port is removed, and
  not just a portion of the bits associated with the bus. You can resize a
  bus port, eliminating bits, using the resize_port_bus command.

  The remove_port command will remove ports that have been added with the
  create_port command, but cannot delete ports that are defined in the RTL or
  netlist design.

  Netlist editing changes the in-memory view of the netlist in the current
  design. It does not change the files in the source fileset, or change the
  persistent design on the disk. Changes made to the netlist may be saved to
  a design checkpoint using the write_checkpoint command, or may be exported
  to a netlist file such as Verilog, VHDL, or EDIF, using the appropriate
  write_* command.

  Note: Netlist editing is not allowed on the elaborated RTL design.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <ports> - One or more names of ports to remove.

Examples:

  The following example deletes the specified port:

    remove_port PORT0

  The following example deletes the two specified ports of a bus:

    remove_port BUS[1] BUS[2]

  The following example deletes both the N and P sides of a differential pair
  port:

    remove_port D_BUS_P[0]

  Note: Deleting either the N or the P side of a differential pair will also
  delete the other side of the pair.
