Description:

  Opens the specified Vivado Design Suite project file (.xpr), or the project
  file for the Vivado Lab Edition (.lpr).

  Note: The open_project command has a different command syntax in the Vivado
  Lab Edition. The -part option is not supported because the Vivado Lab
  Edition project (.lpr) does not specify a target part. The
  current_hw_target and current_hw_device commands determine the target part.

  This command returns a transcript of its process and the name of the
  created project, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -part <arg> - (Optional) Specify a target part to use when opening the
  project. This option lets you change the speed grade of the part used by a
  saved project, or change early availability parts for production parts of
  the same device and package. This option is not supported in Vivado Lab
  Edition.

  Note: The use of -part is limited in terms of the range of parts that can
  be used, and can result in an error when opening the project if an
  incompatible part is specified.

  -read_only - (Optional) Open the project in read only mode. You will not be
  able to save any modifications to the project unless you use the
  save_project_as command to save the project to a new editable project.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - (Required) The project file to open. You must include both the
  path to the file and the .xpr file extension.

Examples:

  The following example opens the project named my_project1 located in the
  Designs directory.

    open_project C:/Designs/project1.xpr

  Note: The project must be specified with the .xpr extension for the tool to
  recognize it as a project file. The path to the file must be specified
  along with the project file name or the tool will return an error that it
  cannot find the specified file.
