Description:

  Update the INPUT_VALUE and ACTIVITY_VALUE properties of the input probes of
  the specified VIO debug cores with values read from the hw_vio core on the
  hardware device.

  The Virtual Input/Output (VIO) debug core can both monitor and drive
  internal signals on a programmed Xilinx device in real time. The VIO core
  uses hardware probes, hw_probe objects, to monitor and drive signals on the
  device. Input probes monitor signals as inputs to the VIO core. Output
  probes drive signals to specified values from the VIO core.

  The refresh_hw_vio command reads the signal values at the input probes of
  the VIO debug core on the device, and applies the value to the INPUT_VALUE
  property of the hw_probe, and updates the ACTIVITY_VALUE property on the
  probe as well.

  This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -update_output_values - (Optional) Update hardware probe OUTPUT_VALUE
  property with values read from the signals at the specified VIO debug
  cores. This is a boolean argument enabled by its presence. This option has
  the affect of resetting the OUTPUT_VALUE on the probe to match the signal
  value on the hw_vio debug core.

  Note: This is the reverse of the commit_hw_vio command, which applies the
  OUTPUT_VALUE on the probe to the hw_vio debug core on the device.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_vios> - (Required) Specify one or more hw_vio objects to refresh. The
  hw_vio objects can either be specified as objects returned by the
  get_hw_vios command, or specified by name.

Example:

  The following example refreshes the specified hw_vio debug core, specified
  by name, including updating the OUTPUT_VALUE property on the hw_probes:

    refresh_hw_vio -update_output_values hw_vio_1
