Description:

  Refresh the connection to the specified hardware target on the current
  hardware server, and reload the hw_target object in the Hardware Manager of
  the Vivado Design Suite. If no hw_target object is specified, the
  current_hw_target will be refreshed.

  The hardware target is a system board containing a JTAG chain of one or
  more Xilinx devices that you can program with a bitstream file, or use to
  debug your design. Connections between hardware targets on the system board
  and the Vivado Design Suite are managed by the Xilinx hardware server
  application, and the connect_hw_server command. Refer to Vivado Design
  Suite User Guide: Programming and Debugging (UG908) for a list of supported
  JTAG download cables and devices.

  Each hardware target can have one or more Xilinx devices to program, or to
  use for debugging purposes. The current device is specified or returned by
  the current_hw_device command. After specifying the current hardware
  target, you can open the connection through the hardware target, to the
  Xilinx FPGA device using the open_hw_target command.

  refresh_hw_target scans the devices on the hardware target and creates,
  deletes, or updates the hw_device objects available through the target.
  Available devices are returned using the get_hw_devices command.

  This command returns a transcript of the refresh process, or returns an
  error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_target> - (Optional) Specify the hw_target object to refresh the
  connection to. The hw_target must be specified as an object as returned by
  the get_hw_targets or current_hw_target commands. If no target is
  specified, the Vivado tool will refresh the connection to the
  current_hw_target.

Example:

  The following example refreshes the current hardware target:

    refresh_hw_target
