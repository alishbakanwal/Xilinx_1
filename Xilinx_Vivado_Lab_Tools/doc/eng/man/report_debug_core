Description:

  Writes a report of the various Vivado device tool debug cores in the
  current project, and the parameters of those cores. Debug cores can be
  added to a project using the create_debug_core command.

  Note: By default the report is written to the Tcl console or STD output.
  However, the results can also be written to a file or returned as a string
  if desired.

Arguments:

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file. The
  specified file will be overwritten if one already exists.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -return_string - (Optional) Return report as a string. This argument can
  not be used with the -file argument.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example writes the debug core report to the specified file
  name at the specified location:

    report_debug_core -file C:/Data/FPGA_Design/project_1_cores.txt
