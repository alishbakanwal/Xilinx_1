Description:

  Returns a list of all input port objects in the current design.

  To get a list of specific inputs in the design, use the get_ports command,
  or use the filter command to filter the results returned by all_inputs.

  The all_inputs command is scoped to return the objects hierarchically, from
  the top-level of the design or from the level of the current instance. By
  default the current instance is defined as the top level of the design, but
  can be changed by using the current_instance command.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example returns all input port objects in the current design:

    all_inputs

  This example gets all input port objects, filters out the GT ports, and
  sets the IOSTANDARD property for the non-GT ports:

    set non_gt_ports [filter [all_inputs] {!is_gt_term}]  
    set_property IOSTANDARD LVCMOS18 $non_gt_ports

  The following example shows how the list returned can be passed to another
  command:

    set_input_delay 5 -clock REFCLK [all_inputs]
