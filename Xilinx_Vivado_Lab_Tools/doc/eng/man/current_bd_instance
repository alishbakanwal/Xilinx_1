Description:

  Set or get the current hierarchical cell instance in the current IP
  Integrator subsystem design, as defined by current_bd_design. The current
  instance is referenced from the top-level of the subsystem design
  hierarchy, or "/".

  This command returns the current IP Integrator cell instance object, or
  returns nothing if the command failed.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <instance> - (Optional) The name of the IP Integrator hierarchical cell to
  be set as the current instance of the subsystem design.

   *  The <instance> is specified relative to the presently defined current
      instance, using the defined hierarchy separator.

   *  Use `..` to move up one level of the hierarchy relative to the current
      instance.

   *  If the <instance> argument is omitted, the current instance is reset to
      the top module in the subsystem design hierarchy.

   *  If the <instance> is specified as `.` then the name of the current
      instance is returned, and the instance is not changed.

Examples:

  The following example sets the current instance in the subsystem design to
  the specified module:

    current_bd_instance module2

  The following example returns the current instance:

    
    current_bd_instance .

  This example resets the current instance of the subsystem design to the top
  level of the hierarchy:

    current_instance /
