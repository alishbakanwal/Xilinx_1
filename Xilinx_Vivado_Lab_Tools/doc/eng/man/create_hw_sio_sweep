Description:

  Create a serial I/O analyzer link sweep object to run multiple scans across
  a range of values.

  To analyze the margin of a given link, it is often helpful to run a scan of
  the link using the specialized features of Xilinx<tm tmtype="reg"/>
  UltraScale<tm tmtype="tm"/> devices or 7 Series FPGAs. It can also be
  helpful to run multiple scans on a the link with different configuration
  settings for the GTs. This can help you determine which settings are best
  for your design. The Vivado<tm tmtype="reg"/> serial I/O analyzer feature
  enables you to define, run, and save link sweeps, or collections of link
  scans run across a range of values.

  This command creates and returns a link sweep object that you can use with
  the run_hw_sio_sweep command to run analysis on the specified links, or GT
  receivers. You can also save the sweep scan to disk using the
  write_hw_sio_sweep command.

  You can remove the created sweep object using remove_hw_sio_sweep.

  This command returns the hw_sio_sweep object, or returns an error if the
  command fails.

Arguments:

  -description <arg> - (Optional) Provide a brief description that acts as a
  label for the serial I/O analyzer sweep scan.

  -iteration_settings <arg> - (Optional) Specify a list of properties to vary
  across multiple scans. Refer to Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Programming
  and Debugging (UG908) for a description of iteration settings.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <scan_type> - (Required) Specify the scan type. Valid types include:

   *  1d_bathtub - Scan all horizontal sampling points through the 0 vertical
      axis.

   *  2d_full_eye - Scan all horizontal and vertical sampling points to
      create an "eye".

  Note: The results of the bathtub scan can be saved to a file with
  write_hw__sio_scan, but the plot cannot be displayed in the Vivado serial
  I/O analyzer using display_hw_sio_scan.

  <hw_sio_link> - (Required) Specify the hw_sio_link to define the sweep
  object for. The link must be specified as objects as returned by the
  get_hw_sio_links command.

Example:

  The following example defines a variable for the hw_sio_sweep object
  created, then runs the sweep scan:

    set xil_newSweep [create_hw_sio_sweep -description {Sweep 0} 2d_full_eye \  
       [lindex [get_hw_sio_links *MGT_X0Y10/TX*] 0 ]] 
    run_hw_sio_sweep [get_hw_sio_sweeps $xil_newSweep]
