Description:

  Delete specified objects from the current IP Integrator subsystem design.

  Objects must be passed directly to the delete_bd_objs command, and not
  simply referenced by the object name. Pins are passed to the command by
  get_bd_pins, for instance, rather than by pin name.

  This command returns nothing if it is successful, and returns an error if
  it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - A list of objects to delete from the current IP Integrator
  subsystem design.

Example:

  The following example deletes the various objects from the current
  subsystem design:

    delete_bd_objs [get_bd_nets /Net] [get_bd_nets /vidout_1_vtg_ce] \ 
    [get_bd_nets /newMod1/aclk_1] [get_bd_ports /addr] [get_bd_cells /vidOut_1]

  The following example deletes the same objects, but uses multiple
  delete_bd_objs commands to clarify the objects that are being deleted by
  grouping them by type:

    delete_bd_objs [get_bd_nets /Net] [get_bd_nets /vidout_1_vtg_ce] \ 
    [get_bd_nets /newMod1/aclk_1] 
    delete_bd_objs [get_bd_ports /addr] 
    delete_bd_objs [get_bd_cells /vidOut_1]
