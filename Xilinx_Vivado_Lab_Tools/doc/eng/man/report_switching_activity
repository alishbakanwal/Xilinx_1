Description:

  This command is used to report different kinds of switching activity on
  design nets, ports, pins, and cells in the current synthesized or
  implemented design. These include simple signal rate and simple static
  probability on nets, ports, and pins; and state dependent static
  probabilities on cells.

  The reported values are defined using the set_switching_activity command.

  Note: This command returns the switching activity for the specified
  objects, or the current design.

  By default the report is written to the Tcl console or STD output. However,
  the results can also be written to a file or returned as a string if
  desired.

Arguments:

  -static_probability - (Optional) Specifies that the command returns static
  probability as part of the report.

  -signal_rate - (Optional) Specifies that the command returns the signal
  rate as part of the report.

  -toggle_rate - (Optional) Report the toggle rate (%) as the switching rate
  of the output of synchronous logic elements compared to a given clock
  input.

  -default_static_probability - (Optional) Reports the default static
  probability to be used in power analysis on the current design. The default
  static probability is set using the set_switching_activity command.

  Note: This option does not require objects to be specified since the
  default applies to the current design.

  -default_toggle_rate - (Optional) Reports the default toggle rate to be
  used in power analysis on the primary inputs of the current design. You can
  define the default toggle rate using the set_switching_activity command.

  Note: This option does not require objects to be specified since the
  default applies to the current design.

  -file <filename> - (Optional) Write the report to the specified path and
  file.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -return_string - (Optional) Returns the data as a text string for
  assignment to a Tcl variable.

  -hier - (Optional) Report the switching activity hierarchically for signals
  in the specified hierarchical <objects>. Without -hier, the switching
  activity is applied to the specified <objects> at the current level of the
  hierarchy.

  -all - (Optional) Must be used with -type, report the switching activity on
  nets within all instances specified by -type.

  -type <arg> - (Optional) Report the switching activity for the specified
  type of logic entity. By default, the command is applied to the top-level
  of the current design, or to the specified <objects>. The -type option
  applies the command settings to the specified type of logic objects in the
  top-level of the current design. The -all option or -hier option can be
  used to modify the scope of objects the command applies to. Valid logic
  types include:

   *  io_output - Primary outputs.

   *  io_bidir_enable - Enable pin of Bidir ports.

   *  register - All register outputs in the design/hierarchy specified.

   *  lut - All LUT outputs in the design/hierarchy specified.

   *  lut_ram - All distributed ram outputs in the design/hierarchy specified.

   *  dsp - All DSP outputs in the design/hierarchy specified.

   *  bram_enable - Enable pins (ENARDEN/ENBWREN) of BRAMs.

   *  bram_wr_enable - Write enables of BRAMs (WEA/WEBWE).

   *  gt_txdata - Output TX data pins of all GTs.

   *  gt_rxdata - Output RX data pins of all GTs.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - (Optional) A list of port, pin, and net objects to report the
  switching activity of; or a list of cells when specified with -type to
  define logic objects.

Examples:

  The following example reports the signal_rate and static probability value
  on all output ports:

    report_switching_activity -signal_rate -static_probability [all_outputs]

  The following example reports the signal_rate and static probability value
  on all LUT objects in the design:

    report_switching_activity -signal_rate -static_probability -type lut -all
