Description:

  Saves any changes to the constraints files of the active constraints set.
  This command writes any changes to the constraints files to the project
  data on the hard drive; saving any work in progress and committing any
  changes.

Arguments:

  -force - (Optional) Save the active constraints files regardless of whether
  any changes have been made, overwriting the current target constraints
  file.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example saves the constraints files for the active
  constraints set regardless of any changes to the files:

    save_constraints -force
