Description:

  Returns a list of all latches that have been declared in the current design.

  The list of latches returned by all_latches can also be limited or reduced
  by the filter command to filter according to properties assigned to the
  latches. Properties of an object can be returned by the list_property or
  report_property commands.

  The all_latches command is scoped to return the objects hierarchically,
  from the top-level of the design or from the level of the current instance.
  By default the current instance is defined as the top level of the design,
  but can be changed by using the current_instance command.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example returns a list of all latches in the current design:

    all_latches

  The following example shows how the list returned can be passed to another
  command:

    set_false_path -from [all_mults] -to [all_latches]
