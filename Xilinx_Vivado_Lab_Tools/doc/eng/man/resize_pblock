Description:

  Place, resize, move, or remove the specified Pblock. The Pblock must have
  been created using the create_pblock command.

  A Pblock consists of a group of cells that can be assigned to one or more
  independent or overlapping rectangles. Using the various options defined
  below, you can add sites to a rectangle, or remove sites from a rectangle,
  or define a new rectangle to be associated with an existing Pblock.

Arguments:

  -add <args> - (Optional) Add the specified range of sites to the Pblock.
  The SLICE range is specified as a rectangle from one corner to the
  diagonally opposite corner. For example SLICE_X0Y0:SLICE_X20Y12.

  Note: Multiple site types are added as separate rectangles.

  -remove <args> - (Optional) Remove the specified range of sites from the
  Pblock. Removing sites from a Pblock may result in the Pblock being broken
  into multiple smaller rectangles to enforce the requirement that Pblocks
  are defined as one or more rectangles.

  -from <args> - (Optional) The -from and -to options must be used as a pair,
  and specify a site or range of sites to relocate from one location to
  another.

  -to <args> - (Optional) The -from and -to options must be used as a pair,
  and specify a site or range of sites to relocate from one location to
  another.

  -locs <args> - (Optional) Specifies how the placed logic in the Pblock will
  be handled as the Pblock is moved or resized. Valid values are:

   *  keep_all - leave all locs placed as they are currently. This is the
      default setting when -locs is not specified. Logic that is placed
      outside of the Pblock will no longer be assigned to the Pblock.

   *  keep_only_fixed - Specifies that only user-placed logic (fixed) will be
      preserved. Unfixed placed logic will be unplaced.

   *  keep_none - Unplace all logic.

   *  move - Specifies that all locs should be moved relative to the
      coordinates of the Pblock.

   *  move_unfixed - Specifies that only the unfixed placed elements should
      be moved. Logic placed by the user (fixed) will not be moved.

   *  trim - Specifies that logic that falls outside of the new Pblock
      boundaries will be unplaced. Any placed logic that still falls inside
      of the Pblock boundary will be left placed as it is.

   *  trim_unfixed - Trim only the unfixed placed logic.

  -replace - (Optional) Remove all rectangles associated with the Pblock.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <pblock> - (Required) Specify the Pblock to be resized, moved, or removed.

Examples:

  The following example resizes the Pblock by adding a range of SLICEs, and
  removing other SLICEs, but keeps all instances placed at their current
  location:

    
    resize_pblock block3 -add SLICE_X6Y67:SLICE_X11Y71 \ 
       -remove SLICE_X6Y71:SLICE_X7Y71 -locs keep_all

  The following example moves the specified Pblock by adding a range of
  SLICEs, removing the existing range of SLICEs, and trims any placed logic
  that falls outside the new Pblock. Then it adds a new range of SLICEs and
  block ram to the specified Pblock in a second separate rectangle:

    resize_pblock block3 -add SLICE_X3Y8:SLICE_X10Y3 \ 
       -remove SLICE_X6Y67:SLICE_X11Y71 -locs trim 
    resize_pblock block3 -add {SLICE_X6Y67:SLICE_X11Y71 \ 
       RAMB18_X0Y2:RAMB18_X1Y4}
