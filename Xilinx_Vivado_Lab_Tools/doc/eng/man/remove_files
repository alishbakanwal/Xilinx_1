Description:

  Removes the specified file objects from the current or specified fileset.
  The file is removed from the current project, but is not removed from the
  disk.

  Files can be specified as file name strings, or as file objects returned by
  the get_files command. When specified as strings, the file is looked for in
  the current or specified fileset. When the file object is specified by
  get_files, the fileset is defined by the object, and -fileset is ignored.

  When successful, this command returns nothing. If the specified file is not
  found, an error is returned.

Arguments:

  -fileset <arg> - (Optional) The name of the fileset to locate the specified
  files. As a default, the files will be removed from the current fileset as
  defined by the current_fileset command.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <files> - (Required) The name of the files to remove from the project.

  Note: If no files are specified, no files are removed.

Examples:

  The following example removes the file named C:/Design/top.xdc from the
  constraint set constrs_1:

    remove_files -fileset constrs_1 C:/Design/top.xdc

  Multiple files can be specified as follows:

    remove_files -fileset sim_1 top_tb1.vhdl top_tb2.vhdl

  The following example gets all the file objects in the current project, and
  removes them:

    remove_files [get_files]

  Note: This will remove ALL files from your design.
