Description:

  Reset the hardware VIO debug core outputs to their initial, or "reset" state.

  The Virtual Input/Output (VIO) debug core can both monitor and drive
  internal signals on a programmed Xilinx FPGA device in real time. The VIO
  core uses hardware probes, hw_probe objects, to monitor and drive signals
  on the device. Input probes monitor signals as inputs to the VIO core.
  Output probes drive signals to specified values from the VIO core.

  The reset_hw_vio_outputs command restores the signal values at the output
  probes of the specified hw_vio debug cores to their initial values. This
  affects the signal on the hw_device, but does not affect the OUTPUT_VALUE
  property of the hw_probe objects.

  Note: This command has the effect of resetting the initial value of the
  signal on the hw_vio debug core, without resetting the properties on the
  hw_probe object.

  This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_vios> - (Required) Specify one or more hw_vio objects to reset. The
  hw_vio objects can either be specified as objects returned by the
  get_hw_vios command, or specified by name.

Example:

  The following example resets the output probes on the VIO debug core to the
  initial values on the core when the FPGA device was first configured and
  booted:

    reset_hw_vio_outputs [get_hw_vios {hw_vio_1}]
