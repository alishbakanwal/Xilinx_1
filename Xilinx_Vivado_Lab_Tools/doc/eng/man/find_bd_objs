Description:

  Find a list of pins, ports or interfaces with a given relationship to the
  specified objects.

  This command returns a list of pins, ports or interface objects if
  successful, or returns an error if it fails.

  find_bd_objs -relation <arg> [-boundary_type <arg>] [-thru_hier]
  [-stop_at_interconnect] [-end_type <arg>] [-quiet] [-verbose] <objects>...

Arguments:

  -relation <arg> - (Required) Specifies the relationship of the objects to
  find with the objects specified to seed the search. Valid values are:

   *  connected_to - Find corresponding pins, ports or interfaces that are
      connected to the given source objects. The search occurs within the
      same level of hierarchy as the specified objects. Use the -thru_hier
      option to search across hierarchical boundaries.

   *  addressable_slave - Find pins, ports, or interfaces, that can be
      addressed as slaves by the specified search objects.

   *  addressing_master - Find pins, ports, or interfaces, that address the
      specified search objects as masters.

  -boundary_type [ upper | lower | all ] - (Optional) Used when the specified
  source objects include a pin or interface pin on a hierarchical module. The
  default behavior is "upper", which searches for related objects within the
  same level as the hierarchical module that the pin is found on. If "lower",
  the search occurs inside the hierarchical module that the pin is on. If
  "all", then both the level of the hierarchical module, and inside the
  hierarchical module are searched for related objects.

  Note: This option must be used with -relation connected_to.

  -thru_hier - (Optional) Ignore the boundary of hierarchical blocks when
  performing the search for objects. If used used with -boundary_type lower,
  the search for related objects will start inside the hierarchical module
  the pin is on, and continue searching downward through the hierarchy.

  -stop_at_interconnect - (Optional) Specifies to stop searching at the
  boundary of the AXI Interconnect IP when -thru_hier is specified. Other
  hierarchical blocks are searched as usual.

  -end_type all - (Optional) This option can be specified for bd_pin and
  bd_port type <objects>. The default search for related objects returns all
  of the sink pins attached to a specified source object, and to return the
  source object for a given sink. When -end_type all is specified for a sink
  object, the tool will return the source pin or port of the specified sink
  object, as well as other sink objects that are connected to the source
  object.

  Note: This option must be used with -relation connected_to.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - (Required) One or more objects to use to find related objects.

Example:

  The following example gets pins, ports, and interfaces connected to the
  specified object, across all levels of the block design hierarchy:

    find_bd_objs -relation connected_to -thru_hier \ 
    [get_bd_pins /proc_sys_reset_1/peripheral_aresetn]
