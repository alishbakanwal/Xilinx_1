Description:

  The add_wave_virtual_bus command creates a new virtual bus. The command
  inserts the virtual bus by specified name where specified or by default at
  the end of the existing waveform. It returns a vb### for the newly-created
  virtual bus.

  Note: This command can only be used when running a simulation. At a
  minimum, you must specify an name, which is the name of the new virtual bus

Arguments:

  -into <wcfgGroupVbusObj> - (Optional) Specifies the wave configuration,
  group, or virtual bus into which the new wave object(s) are inserted. If
  <wcfgGroupVbusObj> is a string instead of an object, it is treated as the
  name of a group in the current WCFG. If no such group is found, the tool
  searches the names of the virtual buses of the current WCFG. If still not
  found, the tool searches the names of all WCFG objects. If no -into object
  is specified, the current wave configuration is assumed.

  -at_wave <waveObj> - (Optional) Adds a wave object at a specified wave
  object. If <waveObj> is a string, it is treated as the display name of a
  wave object.

  -after_wave <waveObj> - (Optional) Adds a wave object after a specified
  wave object. If <waveObj> is a string, it is treated as the display name of
  a wave object.

  -before_wave <waveObj> - (Optional) Adds a wave object before a specified
  wave object. If <waveObj> is a string, it is treated as the display name of
  a wave object.

  -reverse - (Optional) Sets the IS_REVERSED property of the new wave
  object(s) to true.

  -radix value - (Optional) Sets the radix property of the new wave object(s)
  to radix. Allowed values are: default, dec, bin, oct, hex, unsigned, and
  ascii.

  -color <arg> - (Optional) Sets the color property of the new wave object(s)
  to the specified color, which can be a pre-defined color name or a color
  specified by a six-digit RGB format (RRGGBB).

  -name <customName> - (Optional) Sets the display_name property of the new
  wave object to <customName>.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  Add a virtual bus of the name dout_tvalid to the existing waveform
  configuration:

    add_wave_virtual_bus dout_tvalid 
       vbus200
