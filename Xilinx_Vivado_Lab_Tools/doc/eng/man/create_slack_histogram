Description:

  Create a slack histogram grouping paths into slack ranges, and displaying
  the results graphically.

  This command provides a graphical slack histogram that requires the tool to
  be running in GUI mode the -name argument to be used.

Arguments:

  -to <args> - (Optional) Specify a clock name, to analyze paths that end in
  the specified clock domain.

  -delay_type <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the type of path delay to analyze
  when creating the slack report. The valid values are min, max, and min_max.
  The default setting for -delay_type is max.

  -num_bins <args> - (Optional) Specify the number of slack bins to divide
  the results into. The number of bins determines the granularity of the
  histogram returned. The range of slack values calculated is divided evenly
  into the specified number of bins, and the paths are grouped into the bins
  according to their slack values. The value can be specified as a number
  between 1 and 100, with a default value of 10.

  -slack_less_than <arg> - (Optional) Report slack on paths with a calculated
  slack value less than the specified value. Used with -slack_greater_than to
  provide a range of slack values of specific interest.

  -slack_greater_than <arg> - (Optional) Report slack on paths with a
  calculated slack value greater than the specified value. Used with
  -slack_less_than to provide a range of slack values of specific interest.

  -group <args> - (Optional) Report slack for paths in the specified path
  groups. Currently defined path groups can be determined with the
  get_path_groups command.

  -report_unconstrained - (Optional) Report delay slack on unconstrained
  paths. By default, unconstrained paths are not analyzed.

  -significant_digits <arg> - (Optional) The number of significant digits in
  the output results. The valid range is 0 to 3. The default setting is 3
  significant digits.

  -scale [ linear | logarithmic ] - (Optional) Specify the Y-axis scale to
  use when presenting the slack histogram. Logarithmic allows for a smoother
  presentation of greatly different values, but linear is the default.

  -name <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the name of the results set for the GUI.
  If the name specified is currently opened, the create_slack_histogram will
  overwrite the current results.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example creates a slack histogram of the current design,
  using the default values, and outputting the results to the named result
  set in the GUI:

    create_slack_histogram -name slack1
