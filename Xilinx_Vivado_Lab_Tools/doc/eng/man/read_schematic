Description:

  Import a native schematic file that was previously exported from the Vivado
  Design Suite using the write_schematic command.

Arguments:

  -name <arg> - (Optional) The name of the Schematic window to open when
  reading the schematic file.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <files> - (Required) The name of the Schematic file to read.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the tool will
  search for the specified file in the current working directory and then in
  the directory from which the tool was launched.

Example:

  The following example reads the specified schematic file and opens a
  Schematic window called "Sheet_1" in the Vivado IDE:

    read_schematic C:/Data/mySchematic.txt -name Sheet_1
