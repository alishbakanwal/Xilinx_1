Description:

  Create a serial I/O analyzer scan object for the specified communication
  link on the IBERT debug core.

  To analyze the margin of a given link, it is often helpful to run a scan of
  the link using the specialized Eye Scan hardware of Xilinx UltraScale
  devices or 7 Series FPGAs. The Vivado serial I/O analyzer feature lets you
  to create, run, and save link scans.

  This command creates and returns a link scan object that you can use with
  the run_hw_sio_scan command to run analysis on the specified links, or GT
  receivers. You can also save the scan to disk using the write_hw_sio_scan
  command.

  You can remove the created scan object using remove_hw_sio_scan.

  This command returns the hw_sio_scan object, or returns an error if he
  command fails.

Arguments:

  -description <arg> - (Optional) Provide a brief description that acts as a
  label for the serial I/O analyzer scan. The description can be used to
  identify the <hw_sio_scan object>. For instance, you can identify the
  receiver port, so that when you are sweeping many ports you can keep track
  of which port the scan plot s for.

  -link_settings <arg> - (Optional) Specify a list of Link properties and
  values to set before running the scan. If no link settings are provided,
  the default settings are used. Refer to Vivado Design Suite User Guide:
  Programming and Debugging (UG908) for a description of scan properties and
  settings.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <scan_type> - (Required) Specify the scan type. Valid types include:

   *  1d_bathtub - Scan all horizontal sampling points through the 0 vertical
      axis.

   *  2d_full_eye - Scan all horizontal and vertical sampling points to
      create an "eye".

  Note: The results of the bathtub scan can be saved to a file with
  write_hw__sio_scan, but the plot cannot be displayed in the Vivado serial
  I/O analyzer using display_hw_sio_scan.

  <hw_sio_object> - (Required) Specify the IBERT debug core link,
  hw_sio_link, or receiver, hw_sio_rx, to define the scan object for. The
  link or receiver must be specified as objects as returned by the
  get_hw_sio_links or get_hw_sio_rxs commands.

  Note: The create_hw_sio_scan command requires the hw_sio_object to be
  specified as a list of one object.

Example:

  The following example defines a scan for the specified link:

    create_hw_sio_scan -description {LoopBack} 2d_full_eye \ 
       [get_hw_sio_links Link_1]
