Description:

  Open an IP subsystem design in the IP Integrator feature of the Vivado IDE.
  The IP subsystem must previously have been created using the
  create_bd_design command.

  This command returns a message with the name of the opened IP subsystem
  design, or returns an error if the command fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - The path and file name of the IP subsystem design to open in the
  IP Integrator feature of the Vivado Design Suite. The name must include the
  file extension.

Examples:

  The following opens the specified IP subsystem design in the current project:

    open_bd_design  C:/Data/project1/project1.src/sources_1/bd/design_1/design_1.bd
