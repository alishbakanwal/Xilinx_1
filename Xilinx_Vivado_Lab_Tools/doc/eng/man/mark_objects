Description:

  Marks specified objects in GUI mode. This command places an iconic mark to
  aid in the location of the specified object or objects. The mark is
  displayed in a color as determined by one of the color options.

  Objects can be unmarked with the unmark_objects command.

  Note: Use only one color option. If both color options are specified, -rgb
  takes precedence over -color.

Arguments:

  -rgb <args> - (Optional) The color to use in the form of an RGB code
  specified as {R G B}. For instance, {255 255 0} specifies the color yellow,
  while {0 255 0} specifies green.

  -color <arg> - (Optional) The color to use for marking the specified object
  or objects. Supported colors are: red, green, blue, magenta, yellow, cyan,
  and orange.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - (Required) One or more objects to be marked.

Examples:

  The following example adds a red icon to mark the currently selected objects:

    mark_objects -color red [get_selected_objects]
