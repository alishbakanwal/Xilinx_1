Description:

  Reloads the current design from the project data on the hard drive. This
  overwrites the in-memory view of the design to undo any recent design
  changes.

Arguments:

  -part <arg> - (Optional) The new target part for the design when it is
  reloaded. This overrides the constraint file part specified in the project
  data on the hard drive.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following command reloads the current design from the project data on
  hard disk. This will overwrite the unsaved changes of the design which are
  in memory.

    refresh_design

  Note: You can use the command to undo a series of changes to the design and
  revert to the previously saved design.

  The following example refreshes the current design using the specified V6
  part as the target device. The second command is required to make the
  selected part the target device for the active implementation run.

    refresh_design -part xc6vcx75tff784-1  
    set_property part xc6vcx75tff784-1 [get_runs impl_6]

  Note: The second command is not required if the target part is not changed.
