Description:

  Note: This command is supported for Xilinx UltraScale devices only, and
  does not support 7 series devices.

  The report_synchronizer_mtbf command reports mean time between failures
  (MTBF) of each clock domain crossing (CDC) synchronizer chain in a design,
  and provides an overall MTBF covering all synchronizers. Synchronizer
  registers must have ASYNC_REG properties with value TRUE to be properly
  identified as synchronizers for reporting.

  Asynchronous clock domain crossings (CDCs) can fail due to metastability as
  data is captured asynchronously and may settle to different values on
  different loads in the circuit. Synchronizer registers are used to improve
  overall circuit reliability for designs which contain multiple clock
  domains, in which asynchronous data transfers occur, or in which external
  asynchronous signals are captured with an internal clock. A synchronizer
  chain consists of two or more registers connected sequentially with the
  first stage capturing the data signal from the asynchronous clock domain.
  The successive register stages provide additional settling time for
  metastable events and increase MTBF. The synchronizer registers must have
  ASYNC_REG properties with values of TRUE. Besides reporting MTBF, the
  ASYNC_REG properties instruct synthesis, simulation and implementation
  tools to optimize for increased MTBF and improve overall behavior of the
  synchronizer circuit.

  Note: Avoid using different set/reset or clock enable control signals on
  registers within a synchronizer chain.

  This command returns the MTBF report, or returns an error if it fails. The
  command issues a warning message when the MTBF cannot be calculated
  correctly, for example when a CDC is improperly constrained. The following
  conditions result in an UNDEFINED synchronizer MTBF value:

   *  One or both clocks of the CDC are unconstrained.

   *  There is a timing violation involving registers in the synchronizer
      chain.

   *  There is a zero toggle rate detected for the CDC data.

  In the case of a zero toggle rate, it may be necessary to use the
  set_switching_activity command to manually override the toggle rate on the
  CDC net with a realistic value. This involves assigning the Toggle Rate and
  the Static Probability:

   *  Toggle Rate: The number of CDC data signal transitions measured in
      Million Transitions per Second.

   *  Static Probability: The percentage of time during which the CDC data
      signal is driven at a high logic level.

  Example: to assign a toggle rate of 12.5% with 0.5 static probability on a
  CDC net named resync[0]:

    set_switching_activity -toggle_rate 12.5 -static_probability 0.5 \ 
    [get_nets resync[0]]

  The report contents include the following data for each synchronizer chain
  in the design:

   *  MTBF: The Mean Time Between Failures for the CDC synchronizer reported
      in dynamic time units, from seconds to years. An invalid MTBF value is
      reported as UNDEFINED.

   *  Data Toggle Rate: The rate at which the CDC data switches, based on the
      default switching activity for the design as reported by
      report_switching_activity. Measured in (Mts) Millions of Transitions
      per Second. The rate can be overridden using the set_switching_activity
      command targeting the CDC net object.

   *  Data Sample Rate: The rate at which the CDC data is sampled, equivalent
      to the synchronizer chain frequency, measured in MHz.

   *  Settling Time: The total amount of positive slack in nanoseconds on the
      timing paths from synchronizer register outputs. Higher Settling Time
      increases MTBF.

   *  Sending Domain: The clock domain of the source of the CDC data. A value
      of UNCONSTRAINED is reported if the source clock is not defined.

   *  Receiving Domain: The clock domain of the destination of the CDC data.
      A value of UNCONSTRAINED is reported if the destination clock is not
      defined.

   *  Number of Stages: This is the length of the synchronizer chain, which
      equals the number of registers with ASYNC_REG value of TRUE. The MTBF
      calculation will determine the likelihood that the output register or
      registers (should the fanout be greater than 1) will experience a
      metastable event. For example in a typical synchronizer containing 2
      registers with the ASYNC_REG property set, the MTBF calculation
      indicates the probability that the output register(s) following the
      last ASYNC_REG register will capture an incorrect value resulting from
      the metastable event. When a synchronizer is connected to more than 1
      output register, the minimum slack from all the paths will be used in
      the MTBF calculation to ensure that all registers capture the same
      logic level.

   *  CDC Net Name: This is the logical net name of the CDC data, the data
      that is captured asynchronously.

  This command returns the MTBF report, or returns an error if it fails.

  The report also includes an overall MTBF calculated using the MTBF of all
  synchronizers in the design, calculated as the inverse of the sum of the
  reciprocals of the individual synchronizer MTBF values: (1 / (1/MTBF_1 +
  1/MTBF_2 + â€¦ + 1/MTBF_N) ) for N synchronizers.

Arguments:

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file. This
  command will overwrite any files of the same name without warning.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string rather than
  to the standard output. The Tcl string can be captured by a variable
  definition and parsed or otherwise processed.

  Note: This argument cannot be used with the -file option.

  -warn_if_mtbf_below <arg> - (Optional) Specify a value as a floating point
  number, below which the Vivado Design Suite will issue a warning in
  addition to the report. The default value is 1e+12.

  -no_header - (Optional) Write the report without the addition of the
  standard header.

  -report_endpoints - (Optional) Report the total number of CDC path
  endpoints. This is the sum of Safe, Unsafe, and Unknown endpoints.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example writes the MTBF report to the specified file:

    report_synchronizer_mtbf -file C:/Data/mtbf_report.txt
