Description:

  Defines the current Value Change Dump (VCD) object, or returns the name of
  the current VCD object in the current simulation.

  A VCD file must be opened and assigned to a VCD object using the open_vcd
  command in order for there to be a current VCD object.

  This command returns the current VCD object.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <VCDObject> - (Optional) The name of the VCD object to set as the current
  object. If a <VCDObject> is not specified, the command returns the current
  VCD object of the active simulation.

Examples:

  The following example sets the specified VCD object as current:

    current_vcd vcd2
