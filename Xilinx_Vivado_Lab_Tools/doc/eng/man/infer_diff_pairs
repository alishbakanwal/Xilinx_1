Description:

  The infer_diff_pairs command can be used in an I/O Pin Planning project,
  after importing the I/O pin information using the read_csv or read_xdc
  command.

  There are several attributes that identify differential pairs in the file:
  Signal Name, DiffPair Signal, DiffPair Type, and I/O Standard.

  The tool will identify differential pairs using the following methods:

   *  Matching Diff Pair - This is a direct definition of the two signals
      which make up a differential pair. Two port entries, each have DiffPair
      Signal values linking to the Signal Name of the other, and have
      complementary DiffPair Type values, one N and one P. The tool checks to
      ensure that the other attributes such as I/O Standard are compatible
      when forming the diff pair.

   *  Unmatched Diff Pair - Two port entries, with complementary DiffPair
      Type values (one N, one P), but only one port has a DiffPair Signal
      linking to the other Signal Name. The tool will create the differential
      pair if all other attributes are compatible.

   *  Single Port Diff Pair - A single port entry with a differential I/O
      Standard, a DiffPair Type value, and a DiffPair Signal that does not
      otherwise appear in the CSV. The tool will create the opposite side of
      the differential pair (the N or P side), with all properties matching
      those on the original port.

   *  Inferred Diff Pair - Two ports entries, with Signal Names that imply
      the N and P side. The tool will infer a differential pair if all other
      attributes are compatible.

  After reading the port definitions from a CSV or XDC file, the tool will
  report that some differential pairs can be inferred from the data. You can
  run the infer_diff_pairs command to infer these differential pairs if you
  choose.

Arguments:

  -file_type [ csv | xdc ] - (Optional) Specify the type of file to import
  when inferring differential pairs. The valid file types are CSV and XDC.
  There is no default; the -file_type must be specified.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - (Optional) The name of the file previously imported.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the tool will
  search for the specified file in the current working directory and then in
  the directory from which the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example imports the specified XDC file, and then infers
  differential pairs from the file:

    read_xdc C:/Vivado_Install/io_1.xdc 
    infer_diff_pairs C:/Vivado_Install/io_1.xdc -file_type xdc
