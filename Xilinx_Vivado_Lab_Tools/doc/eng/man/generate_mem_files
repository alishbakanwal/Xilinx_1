Description:

  For embedded processor based designs, with associated Executable Linkable
  Files (ELF) from the Software Development Kit (SDK), this command merges
  the Block Memory Map (BMM) for the design with the program data in the ELF
  file to generate memory (MEM) files for use during simulation.

  The MEM file is a text file that describes how individual Block RAMs on the
  Xilinx device are grouped together to form a contiguous address space
  called an Address Block, with the ELF data mapped into the memory.

  The file names and the number of MEM files generated is determined by the
  memory map data specified by the processor system IP cores, or IP
  Integrator block designs.

  This command returns the directory where the MEM files are written, or
  returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -force - (Optional) Overwrite the specified output directory if it already
  exists.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <directory> - (Required) The name of the directory to write the memory
  files into.

Example:

  The following example merges the block RAM map with the ELF file data and
  generates MEM files in the specified directory for use during simulation:

    generate_mem_files C:/Data/gen_mem
