Description:

  Remove the specified net from the netlist of an open Synthesized or
  Implemented Design.

  Note: You cannot remove nets from library macros, also called
  macro-primitives.

  To remove a bus, you must specify the primary bus name, and not specify a
  bus index. This ensures that the entire bus is removed, and not just a
  portion of the bits associated with the bus. You can resize a bus,
  eliminating bits of the bus, using the resize_net_bus command.

  Netlist editing changes the in-memory view of the netlist in the current
  design. It does not change the files in the source fileset, or change the
  persistent design on the disk. Changes made to the netlist may be saved to
  a design checkpoint using the write_checkpoint command, or may be exported
  to a netlist file such as Verilog, VHDL, or EDIF, using the appropriate
  write_* command.

  Note: Netlist editing is not allowed on the elaborated RTL design.

Arguments:

  -prune - (Optional) Prune, or remove, any unconnected hierarchical pins,
  ports, or nets, as a result of removing the specified net.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <nets> - (Required) The list of nets to remove from the netlist of the
  current design.

Example:

  Using the following connection network:

    leaf_cell1/pin1 > net1 > block1/pin1 > 
       topnet 
    < block2/pin1 < net2 < leaf_cell2/pin1

  This example will remove block1/pin1, block2/pin1, net1, and net2, but will
  not prune the pins on the leaf cells:

    remove_net topnet -prune

  The following example illustrates the warning returned when trying to
  remove one bit of a bus net, and then removes the entire bus by specifying
  the root name:

    remove_net DataIn_pad_1_i[0] 
    WARNING: [Coretcl-82] No nets matched `DataIn_pad_1_i[0]`. 
    remove_net DataIn_pad_1_i
