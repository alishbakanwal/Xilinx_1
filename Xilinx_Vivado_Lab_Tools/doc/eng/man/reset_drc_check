Description:

  Reset the specified DRC checks to the defaults provided by the Vivado
  Design Suite. This will restore the DRC check to its default configuration,
  including any changes to the IS_ENABLED or SEVERITY properties.

  The IS_ENABLED property can be modified on a specific DRC check to disable
  the rule from being checked, even when it is specified either directly in
  the report_drc command, or as part of a ruledeck.

  The SEVERITY property is a string property that can be modified to change
  the severity associated with a specific DRC rule when a violation is found
  during the report_drc command. The supported values are: FATAL, ERROR,
  "CRITICAL WARNING", WARNING, ADVISORY

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <checks> - (Required) The list of one or more DRC rule checks to reset to
  the tool defaults.

Examples:

  The following example modifies the IS_ENABLED property for the ROAS-1 rule,
  modifies the SEVERITY property for the RFFC-1 rule, and then restores the
  default settings for all checks:

    set_property IS_ENABLED false [get_drc_checks ROAS-1] 
    set_property SEVERITY "Critical Warning" [get_drc_checks RFFC-1] 
    reset_drc_check [get_drc_checks]
