Description:

  This command is intended to undo the grouping of IP Integrator cells into a
  hierarchical module, by either the group_bd_cells or the move_bd_cells
  commands. The command moves the cells inside a selected hierarchical module
  up one level to the parent cell, and then removes the hierarchical module.

  The connections between the selected cells are maintained. The connections
  between these cells and other cells are maintained automatically by
  removing unneeded subsystem ports and pins.

  This command returns 0 if successful, or an error message if it fails.

Arguments:

  -prefix <arg> - (Optional) A prefix name to apply to any cells that are
  moved up one level in the hierarchy.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <cells> - (Required) A hierarchical module defined by the group_bd_cells or
  move_bd_cells commands. Only one hierarchical module can be specified for
  the command at one time.

Example:

  The following example :

    ungroup_bd_cells -prefix up2_ [get_bd_cells myMod2]
