Description:

  Returns a list of sequential register cells or register pins in the current
  design.

  Note: Returned objects includes DSPs and BRAMs as they contain internal
  registers.

  The list of returned objects can be limited by the use of the arguments
  described below. You can limit the list of registers returned to a specific
  clock or clocks, or to registers triggered by the rising or falling edge of
  a specified clock.

  The list of registers returned by all_registers can also be limited or
  reduced by the filter command to filter according to properties assigned to
  the registers. Properties of an object can be returned by the list_property
  or report_property commands.

  You can also get a list of the pins of collected registers instead of the
  register objects by specifying one or more of the pin arguments.

Arguments:

  -clock <args> - (Optional) Return a list of all registers whose clock pins
  are in the fanout of the specified clock.

  -rise_clock <args> - (Optional) Return a list of registers triggered by the
  rising edge of the specified clocks.

  -fall_clock <args> - (Optional) Return a list of registers triggered by the
  falling edge of the specified clocks.

  Note: Do not combine -clock , -rise_clock, and -fall_clock in the same
  command.

  -cells - (Optional) Return a list of register cell objects as opposed to a
  list of pin objects. This is the default behavior of the command.

  -data_pins - (Optional) Return a list of data pins of all registers in the
  design, or of the registers that meet the search requirement.

  -clock_pins - (Optional) Return a list of clock pins of the registers that
  meet the search requirement.

  -async_pins - (Optional) Limit the search to asynchronous pins of the
  registers that meet the search requirement.

  -output_pins - (Optional) Return a list of output pins of the registers
  that meet the search requirement.

  Note: Use the *_pins arguments separately. If you specify multiple
  arguments, only one argument is applied in the following order of
  precedence: -data_pins, -clock_pins, -async_pins, -output_pins.

  -level_sensitive - (Optional) Return a list of the level-sensitive
  registers or latches.

  -edge_triggered - (Optional) Return a list of the edge-triggered registers
  or flip-flops.

  -no_hierarchy - (Optional) Do not search the hierarchy of the design. Only
  search in the level of the current_instance .

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example returns a list of registers that are triggered by the
  falling edge of any clock in the design:

    all_registers -fall_clock [all_clocks]

  The following example sets the minimum delay:

    
    set_min_delay 2.0 -to [all_registers -clock CCLK -data_pins]

  The following example extracts all registers on clk_A with *meta* in the
  name:

    filter [all_registers -clock clk_A] {name =~ *meta*}
