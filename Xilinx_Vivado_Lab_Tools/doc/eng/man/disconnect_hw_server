Description:

  Disconnect the current or specified Vivado tools hardware server from the
  Vivado Design Suite.

  The current hardware server is either the last connected hardware server,
  or one you have manually defined with the current_hw_server command. If you
  disconnect the current hardware server, there will be no defined current
  hardware server until you define a new current hw_server object.

  This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_server> - (Optional) The hw_server to disconnect from the Vivado Design
  Suite. If the server is not specified, the current_hw_server will be
  disconnected. The hardware server must be specified as a hw_server object
  returned by the get_hw_servers or current_hw_server commands.

Example:

  The following example disconnects the specified hardware server from the
  Vivado Design Suite:

    disconnect_hw_server [get_hw_server picasso]
