Description:

  Returns the available hardware targets of the connected hardware servers.

  The hardware target is a system board containing a JTAG chain of one or
  more Xilinx devices that you can program with a bitstream file, or use to
  debug your design. Connections between hardware targets on the system board
  and the Vivado Design Suite are managed by the Xilinx hardware server
  application, and the connect_hw_server command. Refer to Vivado Design
  Suite User Guide: Programming and Debugging (UG908) for a list of supported
  JTAG download cables and devices.

  Use the open_hw_target command to open a connection to one of the available
  hardware targets. The open target is automatically defined as the current
  hardware target. Alternatively, you can define the current target with the
  current_hw_target command, and then open a connection to the current
  target. The Vivado Design Suite directs programming and debug commands to
  the open target through the hardware server connection.

  This command returns a list of available hardware targets through all
  connected hardware servers, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -of_objects <arg> - (Optional) Return the hardware targets of the specified
  hardware server. The hardware server must be specified as a hw_server
  object using the get_hw_servers commands.

  Note: The -of_objects option requires objects to be specified using the
  get_* commands, such as get_cells or get_pins, rather than specifying
  objects by name. In addition, -of_objects cannot be used with a search
  <pattern>.

  -regexp - (Optional) Specifies that the search <patterns> are written as
  regular expressions. Both search <patterns> and -filter expressions must be
  written as regular expressions when this argument is used. Xilinx regular
  expression Tcl commands are always anchored to the start of the search
  string. You can add ".*" to the beginning or end of a search string to
  widen the search to include a substring. See
  http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html for help with regular expression
  syntax.

  Note: The Tcl built-in command regexp is not anchored, and works as a
  standard Tcl command. For more information refer to
  http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/regexp.htm.

  -nocase - (Optional) Perform case-insensitive matching when a pattern has
  been specified. This argument applies to the use of -regexp only.

  -filter <args> - (Optional) Filter the results list with the specified
  expression. The -filter argument filters the list of objects returned by
  get_hw_targets based on property values on the targets. You can find the
  properties on an object with the report_property or list_property commands.
  In the case of the "hw_target" object, "NAME" and "IS_OPENED" are two of
  the properties that can be used to filter results.

  The filter search pattern should be quoted to avoid having to escape
  special characters that may be found in net, pin, or cell names, or other
  properties. String matching is case-sensitive and is always anchored to the
  start and to the end of the search string. The wildcard "*" character can
  be used at the beginning or at the end of a search string to widen the
  search to include a substring of the property value.

  Note: The filter returns an object if a specified property exists on the
  object, and the specified pattern matches the property value on the object.
  In the case of the "*" wildcard character, this will match a property with
  a defined value of "".

  For string comparison, the specific operators that can be used in filter
  expressions are "equal" (==), "not-equal" (!=), "match" (=~), and
  "not-match" (!~). Numeric comparison operators <, >, <=, and >= can also be
  used. Multiple filter expressions can be joined by AND and OR (&& and ||).
  The following gets input pins that do NOT contain the "RESET" substring
  within their name:

    get_pins * -filter {DIRECTION == IN && NAME !~ "*RESET*"}

  Boolean (bool) type properties can be directly evaluated in filter
  expressions as true or not true:

    -filter {IS_PRIMITIVE && !IS_LOC_FIXED}

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <patterns> - (Optional) Match hw_targets against the specified patterns.
  The default pattern is the wildcard `*` which gets a list of all hw_targets
  available on the connected hardware server.

Example:

  The following example returns the available hardware targets on the
  currently connected hardware servers:

    get_hw_targets
