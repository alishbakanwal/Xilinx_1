Description:

  Returns a list of port, pin or cell objects in the fan-in of the specified
  sinks.

  The all_fanin command is scoped to return objects from current level of the
  hierarchy of the design, either from the top-level or from the level of the
  current instance. By default the current instance is defined as the top
  level of the design, but can be changed by using the current_instance
  command. To return the fan-in across all levels of the hierarchy, use the
  -flat option.

Arguments:

  -startpoints_only - (Optional) Find only the timing start points. When this
  option is used, none of the intermediate points in the fan-in network are
  returned. This option can be used to identify the primary driver(s) of the
  sinks.

  -flat - (Optional) Ignore the hierarchy of the design. By default, only the
  objects at the same level of hierarchy as the sinks are returned. When
  using this option, all the objects in the fan-in network of the sinks are
  considered, regardless of hierarchy.

  -only_cells - (Optional) Return only the cell objects which are in the
  fan-in path of the specified sinks. Do not return pins or ports.

  -levels <value> - (Optional) Maximum number of cell levels to traverse. The
  default value is 0.

  -pin_levels <value> - (Optional) Maximum number of pin levels to traverse.
  The default value is 0.

  -trace_arcs <value> - (Optional) Type of network arcs to trace. Valid
  values are "timing", "enabled", and "all"

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <to> - (Required) The pins, ports, or nets from which you want the fan-in
  objects reported.

Examples:

  The following example lists the timing fan-in of the led_pins output port:

    all_fanin [get_ports led_pins[*] ]

  The following example traces back from the clock pin of the specified flip-
  flop to the clock source (an MMCM output pin in this example):

    all_fanin -flat -startpoints_only [get_pins cmd_parse_i0/prescale_reg[7]/C]

  The following examples returns the ports connected to the input pins of
  IDELAYs, ignoring the hierarchy of the design:

    all_fanin -flat -startpoints_only [get_pins IDELAY*/IDATAIN]
