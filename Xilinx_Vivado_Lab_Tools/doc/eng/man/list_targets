Description:

  List the targets that are available for a specified IP core, DSP module, or
  IP Subsystem. The following file types are accepted: .xci, .xco, .mdl, .bd,
  .bxml.

  Use the generate_targets command to generate the listed targets.

  The command returns the list of available targets. If no targets are
  available for the specified file objects, nothing is returned.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <files> - (Required) A files object that contains the list of source files
  to evaluate.

  Note: Use get_files to specify a files object, rather than specifying a
  file name.

Examples:

  The following example lists the available targets for any DSP modules in
  the design:

    list_targets [get_files *.mdl]
