Description:

  This command creates an example design from a predefined template in an
  open project. The target part specified by the open project must be
  compatible with the example design, as defined in the SUPPORTED_PARTS
  property of the example, or an error is returned.

  For the embedded processor example designs, base_microblaze and base_zynq,
  the example design must be created in an open block design in the Vivado IP
  integrator. Embedded processor example designs require the use of a board
  as defined by the BOARD_PART property, rather than a target part. Refer to
  the current_board_part command for more information.

  The command returns the name of the example design used and a transcript of
  commands; or it returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -design <arg> - (Optional) For embedded processor example designs, this
  option specifies the name of the open and current block design to
  instantiate the example design into. This option is required for embedded
  processor example designs. If -design is not specified, an error is
  returned.

  -hier - (Optional) Hierarchy Block

  -options <args> - (Optional) Specify the values of configurable properties
  of the example design.

  Note: The configurable properties (CONFIG.*) of an example design can be
  returned by the report_property or get_property commands.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <template> - Specifies the template design to be instantiated into the
  specified design. The template can be specified by name, or as an object
  returned by the get_example_designs command.

Examples:

  The following example creates a new project as specified, overwriting an
  existing project of the same name if one is found, specifies the BOARD_PART
  property for the project, creates a new empty block design in the Vivado IP
  integrator, and then instantiates the Zynq embedded processor example
  design:

    create_project zynq1 -force 
    set_property BOARD_PART em.avnet.com:zed:1.3 [current_project] 
    create_bd_design myFirstZynq 
    instantiate_example_design -design myFirstZynq \ 
    [lindex [get_example_designs] 1]

  This example reports the configurable properties of the specified example
  design:

    
    report_property [lindex [get_example_designs] 3] CONFIG.*

  This example creates a new empty project as specified, sets a target BOARD
  for the project, creates and opens a new empty block design, and then
  instantiates the configurable example design:

    
    create_project mb1 C:/Data/Vivado_Tutorial/Tutorial_Created_Data/mb1  
    set_property board_part xilinx.com:kcu105:part0:1.1 [current_project] 
    create_bd_design design_1 
    instantiate_example_design -design design_1 \ 
       -options { Data_Cache.VALUE 8K Include_DDR4.VALUE true \ 
       Local_memory.VALUE 128K }\ 
    xilinx.com:design:config_mb:1.0
