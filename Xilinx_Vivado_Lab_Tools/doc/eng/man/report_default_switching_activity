Description:

  Displays the default switching activity currently configured for the
  specified element type.

  The default switching activity values are defined using the
  set_switching_activity command.

  Note: By default the report is written to the Tcl console or STD output.
  However, the results can also be written to a file or returned as a string
  if desired.

Arguments:

  -static_probability - (Optional) Include static probability in the report
  but do not include toggle rate.

  -toggle_rate - (Optional) Include toggle rate in the report but do not
  include static probability.

  Note: Both toggle rate and probability will be reported unless either
  -toggle_rate or -static_probability is specified to limit the results.

  -type <types> - (Required) The component types that are reported. Valid
  values are: input, input_set, input_reset, input_enable, register, dsp,
  bram_read_enable, bram_write_enable, output_enable, clock, all.

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file. The
  specified file will be overwritten if one already exists.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -return_string - (Optional) Return the report as a string rather than a
  data set.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example reports the default switching attributes for dsps:

    report_default_switching_activity -type dsp 
    Default Dsp Probability = 0.50 
    Default Dsp Toggle Rate (%) = 12.50

  The following example reports the default switching attributes for all
  types, and stores it into a Tcl variable swa1:

    set swa1 [report_default_switching_activity -type all -return_string]

  Note: Without the -return_string argument, the command will perform
  correctly, but the $swa variable will not be assigned the reported
  information.
