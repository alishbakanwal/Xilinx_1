Description:

  Export the current IP Integrator subsystem design as a Tcl script file to
  the disk.

  Note: Any directory in the path specified by the <name> option must already
  exist, or the script will not be created.

  The Tcl script file lets you recreate, reuse, and customize IP Integrator
  subsystem designs without having to archive the original subsystem design.

  When working with a new software release, you must use the output script
  from the write_bd_tcl command to create a block design in the same software
  release as the Tcl script was generated. This ensures the availability of
  the needed versions of any IP used in the script. You can then migrate the
  created block design into a new software release.

  This command returns TCL_OK if successful, or TCL_ERROR if it fails, unless
  -quiet is specified.

Arguments:

  -force - (Optional) Overwrite an existing bd_tcl file of the same name if
  it already exists.

  -bd_name <arg> - (Optional) Specify the name to assign to the block diagram
  in the bd_tcl file. When the Tcl script is run, the new block diagram will
  be created with the specified name. By default, the current name of the
  block diagram will be used.

  -no_mig_contents - (Optional) Do not include memory IP PRJ contents into
  the generated Tcl script. By default this content will be included in the
  Tcl script.

  -no_ip_version - (Optional) Do not include the Version in the
  Vendor:Library:Name:Version (VLNV) value that specifies the IP for
  create_bd_cell commands in the write_bd_tcl file. This allows a bd_tcl
  script to create a new block diagram using the latest version of the IP
  from the Vivado IP catalog.

  Note: This can have significant design implications when IP used in a block
  design have undergone major version changes from when the bd_tcl file was
  written to when it is used.

  -bd_folder <arg> - (Optional) Specify the directory where the block diagram
  will be generated when the bd_tcl script is run. This lets you specify the
  block design to be created outside of the directory structure of a project
  where the bd_tcl script is being run.

  -exclude_layout - (Optional) Do not include the graphical layout data of
  the block design in the output Tcl script. This will create a smaller Tcl
  script containing the necessary design elements, but the layout of the
  block design in the Vivado IP integrator design canvas will need to be
  recreated by the tool.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <tcl_filename> - Specify the name of the Tcl file to write. A suffix of
  .tcl will be supplied if no file suffix is specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

Example:

  The following example creates a Tcl script from the current IP Integrator
  subsystem design:

    
    write_bd_tcl C:/Data/myDesign.tcl

  This example creates a Tcl script from the current IP Integrator subsystem
  design, specifies a new name for the block diagram, specifies that IP
  versions should not be included, and also indicates a folder to write the
  block diagram to when it is created by running the output bd_tcl script:

    
    write_bd_tcl -bd_name newMB1 -no_ip_version \ 
       -bd_folder C:/Block_Designs projMB1

  Note: The file suffix of .tcl will be appended to the specified file name,
  resulting in a file name of projMB1.tcl .
