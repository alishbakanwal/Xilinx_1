Description:

  Create a new pin to add to an IP Integrator hierarchical module.

  This command returns the name of the newly created pin object, or returns
  an error message if it failed.

Arguments:

  -from <arg> - (Optional) The starting index of a standard bus pin. This is
  unspecified for single bit pins.

  -to <arg> - (Optional) The ending index of a standard bus pin. This is
  unspecified for single bit pins.

  -dir [ I | O | IO ] - (Required) The direction of the pin. Valid values are
  I for input, O for output, and IO for bidirectional pins.

  -type <arg> - (Optional) Defines the type of the pin as a clock pin (CLK),
  a reset pin (RST), a clock enable pin (CE), an interrupt pin (INTR), or as
  a data pin (DATA). If you do not define the pin type, it will be undefined
  (UNDEF).

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) The name of the subsystem pin to create. The name is
  referenced from the hierarchical module that the pin is being added to:
  /modName/pinname.

Examples:

  The following example creates a new input pin on the specified module in
  the current IP Integrator subsystem design:

    create_bd_pin -dir I -type rst /newMod1/rst 
    /newMod1/rst
