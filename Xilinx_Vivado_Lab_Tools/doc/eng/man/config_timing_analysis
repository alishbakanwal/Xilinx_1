Description:

  This command configures general features of timing analysis.

  Note: This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it
  fails.

Arguments:

  -enable_input_delay_default_clock [ true | false ] - (Optional) Launch
  un-clocked input delays from an internally defined clock for timing
  analysis. The valid values are true or false, with a default setting of
  false.

  -enable_preset_clear_arcs [ true | false ] - (Optional) Enable timing paths
  through asynchronous preset or clear timing arcs. The valid values are true
  or false, with a default setting of false. By default the timing arcs of
  asynchronous resets are disabled in the Vivado timing engine. This option
  lets you enable them for timing analysis to see if problems caused by the
  assertion of the asynchronous reset exist in the design.

  -ignore_io_paths [ true | false ] - (Optional) Ignore paths from primary
  inputs and paths to primary outputs. This lets you eliminate the net delay
  from the input port and to the output port as part of the timing path.

  -disable_flight_delays [ true | false ] - (Optional) Do not add package
  delays to I/O calculations when this option is true.

  -timing_early_launch_at_borrowing_latches [ auto | true | false ] -
  (Optional) Remove clock latency pessimism from the launching enable of
  paths through transparent latches. In an enabled latch the timing path for
  setup/hold calculations originates from the D pin of the latch instead of G
  pin. This option affects those timing paths. This option can be set to true
  to compensate for timing optimism when CRPR is not enabled, the Vivado
  timing engine uses the early launch edge from when the latch opens to
  calculate the launch clock latency. However, when CRPR is enabled, which is
  the default in the Vivado timer, this option is too conservative and should
  be set to false. The default setting is auto which lets the Vivado timing
  engine determine when to eliminate CRPR from paths through enabled latches.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example ignores the package delays during timing analysis:

    config_timing_analysis -disable_flight_delays true
