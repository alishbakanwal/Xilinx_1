Description:

  Returns a list of nodes on the device that match a specified search pattern
  in an open design.

  The default command gets a list of all nodes on the device.

  Note: To improve memory and performance, the get_* commands return a
  container list of a single type of objects (e.g. cells, nets, pins, or
  ports). You can add new objects to the list (using lappend for instance),
  but you can only add the same type of object that is currently in the list.
  Adding a different type of object, or string, to the list is not permitted
  and will result in a Tcl error.

Arguments:

  -of_objects <args> - (Optional) Return the nodes of the specified nets,
  tiles, nodes, bel_pins, site_pins, wires, speed_model or pip objects.

  Note: The -of_objects option requires objects to be specified using the
  get_* commands, such as get_cells or get_pins, rather than specifying
  objects by name. In addition, -of_objects cannot be used with a search
  <pattern>.

  -regexp - (Optional) Specifies that the search <patterns> are written as
  regular expressions. Both search <patterns> and -filter expressions must be
  written as regular expressions when this argument is used. Xilinx regular
  expression Tcl commands are always anchored to the start of the search
  string. You can add ".*" to the beginning or end of a search string to
  widen the search to include a substring. See
  http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html for help with regular expression
  syntax.

  Note: The Tcl built-in command regexp is not anchored, and works as a
  standard Tcl command. For more information refer to
  http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/regexp.htm.

  -nocase - (Optional) Perform case-insensitive matching when a pattern has
  been specified. This argument applies to the use of -regexp only.

  -filter <args> - Filter the results list with the specified expression. The
  -filter argument filters the list of objects returned by get_nodes based on
  property values on the nodes. You can find the properties on an object with
  the report_property or list_property commands. Any property/value pair can
  be used as a filter. In the case of the node object, "IS_INPUT_PIN",
  "IS_BEL_PIN" and "NUM_WIRES" are some of the properties that can be used to
  filter results.

  The filter search pattern should be quoted to avoid having to escape
  special characters that may be found in net, pin, or cell names, or other
  properties. String matching is case-sensitive and is always anchored to the
  start and to the end of the search string. The wildcard "*" character can
  be used at the beginning or at the end of a search string to widen the
  search to include a substring of the property value.

  Note: The filter returns an object if a specified property exists on the
  object, and the specified pattern matches the property value on the object.
  In the case of the "*" wildcard character, this will match a property with
  a defined value of "".

  For string comparison, the specific operators that can be used in filter
  expressions are "equal" (==), "not-equal" (!=), "match" (=~), and
  "not-match" (!~). Numeric comparison operators <, >, <=, and >= can also be
  used. Multiple filter expressions can be joined by AND and OR (&& and ||).
  The following gets input pins that do NOT contain the "RESET" substring
  within their name:

    get_pins * -filter {DIRECTION == IN && NAME !~ "*RESET*"}

  Boolean (bool) type properties can be directly evaluated in filter
  expressions as true or not true:

    -filter {IS_PRIMITIVE && !IS_LOC_FIXED}

  -uphill - (Optional) Return the nodes uphill of objects specified by the
  -of_objects option. Uphill nodes precede the specified object in the logic
  network.

  -downhill - (Optional) Return the nodes downhill of objects specified by
  the -of_objects option. Downhill nodes follow the specified object in the
  logic network.

  -flyover - (Optional) Return the nodes that pass through (or flyover) the
  specified tiles.

  -from <args> - (Optional) Defines the starting points of the nodes to get
  from site_pin or pip objects. This option can be combined with -uphill. The
  default is to return nodes downhill of a start point. By default, all nodes
  will be returned.

  -to <args> - (Optional) Defines the ending points of the nodes to get from
  site_pin or pip objects. This option can be combined with -uphill. The
  default is to return nodes downhill of a start point to the specified end
  point. By default, all nodes will be returned.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <patterns> - (Optional) Return nodes matching the specified search
  patterns. The default pattern is the wildcard `*` which gets a list of all
  nodes on the device. More than one search pattern can be specified to find
  nodes based on different search criteria.

  Note: You must enclose multiple search patterns in braces, {}, or quotes,
  "", to present the list as a single element.

Examples:

  The following example returns the nodes associated with the specified tile:

    get_nodes -of_objects [get_tiles CLBLM_R_X11Y158]

  The following example returns the nodes downhill from the specified node:

    get_nodes -downhill -of_objects [get_nodes LIOB33_SING_X0Y199/IOB_PADOUT0]
