Description:

  Returns a list of all the RAM cell objects present in the current instance,
  including Block RAMS, Block RAM FIFOs, and Distributed RAMS. These RAM cell
  objects can be assigned to a variable or passed into another command.

  To get a list of specific RAM cells in the design, use the filter command
  to filter the results returned by all_rams based on properties assigned to
  the RAM cells. Properties of an object can be returned by the list_property
  or report_property commands.

  The all_rams command is scoped to return the objects hierarchically, from
  the top-level of the design or from the level of the current instance. By
  default the current instance is defined as the top level of the design, but
  can be changed by using the current_instance command.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example returns all RAM cells in the design:

    all_rams

  This example returns all RAM cells in the design, and filters the results
  to return only the FIFO block memories:

    filter [all_rams] {PRIMITIVE_SUBGROUP == fifo}

  The following example sets the current instance, and returns all RAM
  objects hierarchically from the level of the current instance:

    current_instance usbEngine0 
    all_rams
