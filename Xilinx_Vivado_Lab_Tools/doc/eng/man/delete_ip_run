Description:

  Deletes the out-of-context (OOC) synthesis and implementation runs for the
  specified IP module.

  The contents of the run directory are deleted from the project as well as
  the run. However, the output products created by the run and copied to the
  IP sources folder, the DCP file and Verilog and VHDL structural netlists,
  are not deleted from the project. You must use the reset_target or
  generate_target command to update the IP output products.

  Note: The command requires an IP object as specified by the get_ips or
  get_files command, and will not delete a run based on either the name of
  the run, or a run object as returned by get_runs.

Arguments:

  -force - Force the deletion of the run.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - (Required) The IP object or file to delete the run from. An IP
  can be specified as an object using the get_ips command, or as a file (XCI)
  using the get_files command.

Examples:

  The following example deletes the OOC synthesis and implementation runs
  from the specified IP module:

    delete_ip_run [get_ips add1]

  Note: In this example, all run results will also be removed from the run
  directory on the hard drive.
