Description:

  Close the connection to the current or specified hardware target that was
  previously opened using the open_hw_target command.

  The hardware target is a system board containing a JTAG chain of one or
  more Xilinx devices that you can program with a bitstream file, or use to
  debug your design. Connections between hardware targets on the system board
  and the Vivado Design Suite are managed by the hw_server application. Refer
  to Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Programming and Debugging (UG908) for a
  list of supported JTAG download cables and devices.

  This command returns connection messages from the hardware server, or
  returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_target> - (Optional) Specify the hw_target object to close the
  connection to. The hw_target must be specified as an object as returned by
  the get_hw_targets or current_hw_target commands. If no target is
  specified, the open connection to the current_hw_target will be closed.

Example:

  The following example closes the current hardware target:

    close_hw_target
