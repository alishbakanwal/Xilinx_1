Description:

  Sets clock sense at specified ports or pins. This is used to define the
  positive or negative unateness at the pin relative to a clock object.
  However, the specified unateness only applies at a non-unate point in the
  clock network, at a point where the clock signal cannot be determined.
  Since the clock signal is not determined, the defined clock sense
  propagates forward from the given pins.

  Note: This command operates silently and does not return direct feedback of
  its operation.

Arguments:

  -positive - (Optional) The unate clock sense is positive (non_inverting).

  -negative - (Optional) The unate clock sense is negative (inverting).

  -stop_propagation - (Optional) Stop the propagation of clocks in the
  -clocks argument from the specified pins or ports. Propagation of the clock
  as clock and data is stopped.

  Note: -positive, -negative, and -stop_propagation are mutually exclusive.

  -clocks <args> - (Optional) A list of clocks on which to apply the clock
  sense for the specified pins and ports . If the -clocks argument is not
  used, the clock sense will be applied to all clocks passing through the
  specified pins and ports.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <pins> - (Required) List of ports and pins to propagate the clock sense to.

Examples:

  The following example specifies that only the positive unate paths will
  propagate through the output pin of the XOR gate as compared with the
  original clock.

    set_clock_sense -positive [get_pins xor_a.z]
