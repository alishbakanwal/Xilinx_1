Description:

  Create new nets in the current netlist of an open Synthesized or
  Implemented Design.

  Note: You cannot add nets to library macros, or macro-primitives.

  Nets can be created hierarchically from the top-level of the design, or
  within any level of the hierarchy by specifying the hierarchical net name.

  Bus nets can be created with increasing or decreasing bus indexes, using
  negative and positive index values.

  New nets are unconnected in the netlist at the time of creation. You must
  connect nets as desired using the connect_net command. Connected nets can
  be unconnected using the disconnect_net command, and can be removed from
  the netlist using the remove_net command.

  Netlist editing changes the in-memory view of the netlist in the current
  design. It does not change the files in the source fileset, or change the
  persistent design on the disk. Changes made to the netlist may be saved to
  a design checkpoint using the write_checkpoint command, or may be exported
  to a netlist file such as Verilog, VHDL, or EDIF, using the appropriate
  write_* command.

  Note: Netlist editing is not allowed on the elaborated RTL design.

Arguments:

  -from <arg> - (Optional) The starting index of a new bus.

  -to <arg> - (Optional) The ending index of a new bus.

  Note: Specifying -from or -to without the other will results in a one-bit
  bus with index value specified by the -from or -to argument.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <nets> - (Required) The names of nets to create. Net names can be specified
  from the top-level, as name only (net1), or can be specified within the
  design hierarchy by specifying the hierarchical net name
  (cell1/cellA/net1).

Example:

  The following example creates a new 24-bit bus in the current Synthesized
  or Implemented Design:

    create_net tempBus -from 23 -to 0
