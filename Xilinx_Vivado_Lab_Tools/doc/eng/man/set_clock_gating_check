Description:

  Defines setup and hold times, specified in nanoseconds, for gated clocks.
  Clock gating is a power saving technique used in many synchronous circuits.
  Gated clocks increase clock skew and add timing delay which must be
  accounted for during timing analysis.

  Note: This command operates silently and does not return direct feedback of
  its operation.

Arguments:

  -setup <value> - (Optional) Clock-gating setup time, specified in
  nanoseconds. Valid values are floating point numbers >= 0. The default is
  0.

  -hold <value> - (Optional) Clock-gating hold time. Valid values are
  floating point numbers >= 0. The default is 0.

  -rise - (Optional) Specifies only rising value for the defined checks.

  -fall - (Optional) Specifies only falling value for the defined checks.

  -high - (Optional) Specifies check against high of clock waveform.

  -low - (Optional) Specifies check against low of clock waveform.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - (Optional) A list of clocks, ports, pins, or cells on which to
  aplply the setup and hold times.

Examples:

  The following example will apply a setup requirement of 0.5 and a hold
  requirement of 0.5 on all gates in the specified clock:

    set_clock_gating_check -setup 0.5 -hold 0.5 cpuClk
