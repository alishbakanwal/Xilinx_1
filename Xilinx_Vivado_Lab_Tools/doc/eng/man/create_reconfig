  Create and add a new Reconfigurable Module to a cell. The cell will be
  marked as a Reconfigurable Partition if it is not already.

Arguments:

  -force - (Optional) Run the command, even if there are pending constraint
  changes, which will be lost

  -blackbox - (Optional) Create a Black Box Reconfigurable Module. Source and
  constraint files may not be added to a Black Box RM.

  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) - The name of the new reconfigurable module.

Examples:

  The example below creates a reconfigurable module with a name BramFirst on
  an instance U1_RP_Bram:

    
    create_reconfig_module -name BramFirst -cell U1_RP_Bram

  The example below creates a Blackbox reconfigurable module named Bram_BB:

    create_reconfig_module -name Bram_BB -cell U1_RP_Bram -blackbox
