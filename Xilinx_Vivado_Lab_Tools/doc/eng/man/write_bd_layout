Description:

  Write the current open block design in the Vivado IP integrator to the
  specified file format.

  This command lets you print the block design, output it as a vector graphic
  file for use in documentation related to the design project, or recreate
  the block design layout in the Vivado IP integrator design canvas using the
  regenerate_bd_layout command.

  This command returns the name of the file written, or returns an error if
  it fails.

Arguments:

  -force - (Optional) Overwrite an existing file of the specified name.

  -format [ native | pdf | svg ] - (Optional) Write the output file in the
  specified format. The default file format is native, and describes an
  internal Vivado tool format that can be used to recreate the block design
  layout in the Vivado IP integrator using the regenerate_bd_layout command.
  SVG is scalable vector graphics format. PDF is portable document format.

  Note: regenerate_bd_layout can be used with the native format.

  -orientation [ landscape | portrait ] - (Optional) Specify the orientation
  of the graphic file as either landscape (horizontal) or portrait (vertical)
  orientation. The default orientation is portrait.

  -scope [ visible | all ] - (Optional) Defines the scope of the block design
  to output to the specified file. The default is all, and indicates to
  output the whole block design. The visible outputs only the currently
  displayed limits of the design canvas, or the current zoom value.

  -hierarchy <arg> - (Optional) Output the drawing of the specified
  hierarchical bd_cell. Blocks can be specified by the get_bd_cells command.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - (Required) Write the block design canvas into the specified file.
  If the specified file already exists, you must also use the -force option
  to overwrite it, or an error is returned.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example prints the current block design to the specified PDF
  file:

    write_bd_layout -format pdf -orientation landscape C:/Data/microblaze.pdf

  The following example prints the specified hierarchical cell of the block
  design to the specified SVG file:

    write_bd_layout -format svg -orientation landscape C:/Data/microblaze.svg
