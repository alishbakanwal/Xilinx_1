Description:

  Report the fanout of nets in the design, starting with the highest fanout
  nets, and working down. Options allow you to control various aspects of the
  report.

  This command can be run on an implemented design, or on the synthesized
  netlist. However, the results will be more complete on the implemented
  design.

  The command returns the fanout report of nets in the design, or returns an
  error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file. The
  specified file will be overwritten if one already exists, unless -append is
  also specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -format [ text | xml ] - (Optional) The default format of the output report
  is text. You can also output an XML report. XML output is only valid when
  -file is specified, and cannot be used with -append.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -ascending - (Optional) Report nets in ascending order.

  -timing - (Optional) Add timing data to the report to display the worst
  slack (WNS) and worst delay on high fanout nets.

  Note: The -timing option will slow the run time of report_high_fanout_nets
  , and is not supported for use with -histogram .

  -histogram - (Optional) Format the report as a histogram showing the number
  of fanouts, and the number and percentage of nets with that many fanouts in
  the design.

  Note: This option cannot be used with with the following options:
  -ascending, -timing, -load_types , -clock_regions, -slr, -max_nets.

  -load_types - (Optional) Reports the various load types on the net sorted
  in two different ways: by load types (data/clock/set/reset...) and by
  device resource at which loads are placed (Slices/IO...). When
  report_high_fanout_nets is run on the unplaced synthesized design only the
  load type is reported.

  -clock_regions - (Optional) Report the load distribution across clock
  regions. This option can only be used after placement, and reports the
  clock regions the various loads on the net are located in.

  -slr - (Optional) Report the load distribution across SLRs. This option can
  only be used after placement, and reports the SLRs that various loads on
  the net are located in, after placement.

  -max_nets <arg> - (Optional) Number of nets to report. Default: 10

  -fanout_greater_than <arg> - (Optional) Report only nets that have fanout
  greater than or equal to the specified limit. The value can be specified as
  an integer, with a default value of 1.

  -fanout_lesser_than <arg> - (Optional) Report only nets that have fanout
  less than or equal to the specified limit. The value can be specified as an
  integer, with a default value of INT_MAX.

  -name <arg> - (Optional) The name of the High Fanout Nets Report view to
  display in the Vivado IDE when run in GUI mode. If the name has already
  been used in an open Report view, that view will be closed and a new report
  opened.

  -cells <args> - (Optional) Report the nets attached to the specified cell
  instances in the design.

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string rather than
  to the standard output. The Tcl string can be captured by a variable
  definition and parsed or otherwise processed.

  Note: This argument cannot be used with the -file option.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example reports the top 100 nets with fanouts greater than 50
  loads:

    
    report_high_fanout_nets -fanout_greater_than 50 -max_nets 100

  This example reports a histogram of nets with fanouts less than 10 loads,
  and returns the results to a string stored as a Tcl variable:

    set myRep [report_high_fanout_nets -histogram \ 
       -fanout_lesser_than 10 -return_string ]
