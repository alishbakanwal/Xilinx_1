Description:

  Returns a list of all clocks that have been declared in the current design.

  To get a list of specific clocks in the design, use the get_clocks command,
  or use the filter command to filter the results returned by all_clocks.

  Clocks can be defined by using the create_clock or create_generated_clock
  commands.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example shows all clocks in the sample CPU netlist project:

    % all_clocks 
    cpuClk wbClk usbClk phy_clk_pad_0_i phy_clk_pad_1_i fftClk

  The following example applies the set_propagated_clock command to all
  clocks, and also demonstrates how the returned list (all_clocks) can be
  passed to another command:

    % set_propagated_clock [all_clocks]
