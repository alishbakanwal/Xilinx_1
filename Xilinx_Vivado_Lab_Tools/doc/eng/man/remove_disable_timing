Description:

  Removes a disabled timing constraint by specifying the start and end points
  of the timing arc. The command contains "from" and "to" arguments. The from
  argument determines the start point. The to argument is the end point.

  Note: This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it
  fails.

Arguments:

  -from <value> - (Optional) From Pin on Cell

  -to <value> - (Optional) To Pin on Cell

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - (Optional) List of cells or pins, ports, lib-cells, lib-pins,
  libcell/cell timing-arcs

Examples:

  The following command removes a disabled timing constraint in between the
  start point EN_A to D_IN:

    
    remove_disable_timing -from EN_A -to D_IN
