Description:

  The Block RAM Memory Map (BMM) file is a text file that describes how
  individual block RAMs on an FPGA are grouped together into a contiguous
  address space called an Address Block.

  The write_bmm command exports BMM information from the current design to
  the specified file. For implemented designs the BMM file will be include
  placement information. The data2mem command uses the BMM file as input to
  direct the translation of programming data into the proper form for use in
  simulation, device programming, or software development in SDK.

  The command returns the name of the output file, or an error.

Arguments:

  -force - (Optional) Overwrite the BMM file if it already exists.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - (Required) The filename of the BMM file to write.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

Example:

  The following example writes the BMM file for the current design:

    write_bmm C:/Data/design1.bmm
