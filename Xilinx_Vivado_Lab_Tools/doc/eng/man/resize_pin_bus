Description:

  Resize an existing bus pin, to grow the bus, shrink the bus, or renumber
  the current range of pin indexes. You can only do a single grow, shrink, or
  renumber operation with each command.

   *  You can grow the bus by indicating a new range of pin indexes outside
      the current range of indexes. Growing the bus leaves existing pins
      connected as they currently are.

   *  You can shrink the bus by indicating a new range of pin indexes inside
      the current range of indexes. Shrinking the bus, eliminates connections
      to removed bus pins, but leaves the remaining pins connected as they
      currently are.

   *  You can renumber the current bus indexes by providing a new range of
      pin indexes with the same width as the current range. Renumbering pins
      changes the pin index, but does not otherwise change connections.

  Netlist editing changes the in-memory view of the netlist in the current
  design. It does not change the files in the source fileset, or change the
  persistent design on the disk. Changes made to the netlist may be saved to
  a design checkpoint using the write_checkpoint command, or may be exported
  to a netlist file such as Verilog, VHDL, or EDIF, using the appropriate
  write_* command.

  Note: Netlist editing is not allowed on the elaborated RTL design.

  This command returns nothing if successful, and returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -from <arg> - (Optional) The new starting index of the specified bus pin.

  -to <arg> - (Optional) The new ending index of the specified bus pin.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <bus_pin_name> - (Required) The name of the bus pin to modify. You must
  specify the pin names hierarchically from the cell instance the pin is
  assigned to. Pins created at the top-level of the design are ports, and
  should be resized with the resize_port_bus command.

Examples:

  The following example creates a blackbox cell, then creates a 24-bit
  bidirectional bus for the specified hierarchical cell, then resizes the bus
  pin to expand the width to 32-bits, then renumbers the index to include
  negative bus indexes:

    create_cell -reference dmaBlock -black_box usbEngine0/myDMA 
    create_pin -direction INOUT -from 0 -to 23 usbEngine0/myDMA/dataBus 
    resize_pin_bus -from 0 -to 31 usbEngine0/myDMA/dataBus 
    resize_pin_bus -from -16 -to 15 usbEngine0/myDMA/dataBus
