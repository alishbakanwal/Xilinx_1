Description:

  Define a communication links between transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX)
  objects on the GTs of the IBERT debug core implemented on the current
  hardware device.

  Vivado Serial I/O analyzer is a link-based analyzer, which lets you link
  between any transmitter and receiver within the IBERT design. The links
  define the communication paths and protocols between transmitters and
  receivers of the GigaBit transceivers on the device. You can configure the
  links by using the set_property command to specify property values on the
  link object. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Programming and
  Debugging (UG908) for more information on configuring links.

  This command returns the created hw_sio_link object, or returns an error if
  it fails.

Arguments:

  -description <arg> - (Optional) Provide a brief description that acts as a
  label for the link. This description is stored on the DESCRIPTION property
  of the hw_sio_link object.

  Note: The NAME property of the hw_sio_link objects is a full path
  designation of the link from the transmitter (TX) to receiver (RX) GTs on
  the IBERT debug core, including the hw_server, hw_target, hw_device, and
  hw_sio_ibert objects. Any description you provide here can be used as a
  shortcut to help locate the link.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_sio_rx> - (Optional) Specify the receiver element of the GT to include
  in the communication link. The receiver must be specified as an object as
  returned by the get_hw_rxs command.

  <hw_sio_tx> - (Optional) Specify the transmitter element of the GT to
  include in the communication link. The transmitter must be specified as an
  object as returned by the get_hw_txs command.

  Note: Although the receiver and transmitter are marked as optional, at
  least one must be provided to create a link. A link with only a transmitter
  or receiver is considered an open-ended link.

Example:

  The following example creates a communication link between the specifed RX
  and TX

    create_hw_sio_link -description Link_12  [get_hw_sio_txs *MGT_X0Y12*] \ 
    [get_hw_sio_rxs *MGT_X0Y12*]

  Note: In the example above the TX precedes the RX. The order of these
  objects is not significant.
