Description:

  Groups a set of paths for cost function calculations, primarily for timing
  analysis. Timing paths can be specified generally as from a startpoint, or
  to an endpoint, or as from-through-to specific points. Once a path group
  has been created, some timing analysis can be performed against it with the
  report_timing command.

  Note: This command operates silently and does not return direct feedback of
  its operation.

  The path groups currently defined in a design can be found by using the
  get_path_groups command.

Arguments:

  -name <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the name of the path group. If the path
  group name already exists, the specified paths will be added to the
  existing group.

  -from <args> - (Optional) Include paths starting at the specified
  startpoints. The startpoints can be specified as pins, ports, or clocks.

  -to <path_names> - (Optional) Include all paths to the specified endpoints.
  Endpoints can be specified as pins, ports, or clocks.

  -through <element_names> - (Optional) Include paths routed through the
  specified pins, cells, or nets.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example creates a group named signal_grp to the specified
  registers' endpoints matching *signal*reg/D, and then reports timing on the
  specified group:

    group_path -to [get_pins *signal*reg/D -hierarchical] -name signal_grp 
    report_timing -group  signal_grp

  The path group signal_grp is also returned by the get_path_groups command:

    get_path_groups 
    signal_grp
