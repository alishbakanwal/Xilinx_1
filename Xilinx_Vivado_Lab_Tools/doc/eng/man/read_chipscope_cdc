Description:

  Reads a ChipScope Definition and Connection (CDC) file to associate with a
  Netlist Design in the current project. This file stores information about
  core parameters, and core settings for ChipScope ILA debug cores, and can
  also be used as input to the ChipScope Pro Analyzer to import signal names.

  The ChipScope CDC file can be written by the tool, or from an ISE project,
  through the write_chipscope_cdc command.

  If certain parameters of the CDC file are not acceptable to the current
  project then those parameters will not be imported. For instance, if
  signals specified for connection to ports do not exist in the current
  netlist, those signals will be ignored.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - The path and filename of the CDC file to read into. The CDC file
  defines the debug core to insert, the signals to probe, and the clock
  domains for those signals.

Examples:

  The following example reads the specified CDC file:

    read_chipscope_cdc C:/Data/FPGA_Design/bft.cdc
