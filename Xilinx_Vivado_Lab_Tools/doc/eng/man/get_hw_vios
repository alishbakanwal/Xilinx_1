Description:

  Returns the Virtual Input/Output (VIO) debug core objects that are defined
  on the current hardware device, hw_device.

  The Virtual Input/Output (VIO) debug core can both monitor and drive
  internal signals on a programmed Xilinx FPGA device in real time. In the
  absence of physical access to the target hardware, you can use this debug
  feature to drive and monitor signals that are present on the physical
  device.

  The VIO core has hardware probes, hw_probe objects, to monitor and drive
  specific signals on the design. Input probes monitor signals as inputs to
  the VIO core. Output probes drive signals to specified values from the VIO
  core. Values on the debug core are driven onto the signals at the probe
  using the commit_hw_vio command.

  The VIO debug core needs to be instantiated in the RTL code, therefore you
  need to know what nets you want monitor and drive prior to debugging the
  design. The IP Catalog provides the VIO core under the Debug category.
  Detailed documentation on the VIO core can be found in the LogiCORE IP
  Virtual Input/Output Product Guide (PG159).

  This command returns a list of VIO debug core objects on the device, or
  returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -of_objects <arg> - (Optional) Return the VIO debug cores of the specified
  hardware devices. The devices must be specified as objects using the
  get_hw_devices or the current_hw_device commands.

  Note: The -of_objects option requires objects to be specified using the
  get_* commands, such as get_cells or get_pins, rather than specifying
  objects by name. In addition, -of_objects cannot be used with a search
  <pattern>.

  -regexp - (Optional) Specifies that the search <patterns> are written as
  regular expressions. Both search <patterns> and -filter expressions must be
  written as regular expressions when this argument is used. Xilinx regular
  expression Tcl commands are always anchored to the start of the search
  string. You can add ".*" to the beginning or end of a search string to
  widen the search to include a substring. See
  http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html for help with regular expression
  syntax.

  Note: The Tcl built-in command regexp is not anchored, and works as a
  standard Tcl command. For more information refer to
  http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/regexp.htm.

  -nocase - (Optional) Perform case-insensitive matching when a pattern has
  been specified. This argument applies to the use of -regexp only.

  -filter <args> - (Optional) Filter the results list with the specified
  expression. The -filter argument filters the list of objects returned by
  get_hw_vios based on property values on the VIO debug cores. You can find
  the properties on an object with the report_property or list_property
  commands. In the case of the "hw_vio" object, "NAME" and "INSTANCE_NAME"
  are two of the properties that can be used to filter results.

  The filter search pattern should be quoted to avoid having to escape
  special characters that may be found in net, pin, or cell names, or other
  properties. String matching is case-sensitive and is always anchored to the
  start and to the end of the search string. The wildcard "*" character can
  be used at the beginning or at the end of a search string to widen the
  search to include a substring of the property value.

  Note: The filter returns an object if a specified property exists on the
  object, and the specified pattern matches the property value on the object.
  In the case of the "*" wildcard character, this will match a property with
  a defined value of "".

  For string comparison, the specific operators that can be used in filter
  expressions are "equal" (==), "not-equal" (!=), "match" (=~), and
  "not-match" (!~). Numeric comparison operators <, >, <=, and >= can also be
  used. Multiple filter expressions can be joined by AND and OR (&& and ||).
  The following gets input pins that do NOT contain the "RESET" substring
  within their name:

    get_pins * -filter {DIRECTION == IN && NAME !~ "*RESET*"}

  Boolean (bool) type properties can be directly evaluated in filter
  expressions as true or not true:

    -filter {IS_PRIMITIVE && !IS_LOC_FIXED}

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <patterns> - (Optional) Match hw_vios against the specified patterns. The
  default pattern is the wildcard `*` which gets a list of all hw_vios
  available on the current hardware device.

Example:

  The following example gets the ILA debug cores defined on the current
  hardware device:

    
    get_hw_vios -of_objects [current_hw_device]
