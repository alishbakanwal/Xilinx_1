Description:

  Reads a VHDL source file. This command is similar to the add_files command.
  The VHDL file is added to the source fileset as it is read. If the -library
  argument is specified, the file is added with the Library property defined
  appropriately.

  You can use this command to read the contents of source files into the
  in-memory design, when running the Vivado tool in Non Project mode, in
  which there is no project file to maintain and manage the various project
  source files. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Design Flows
  Overview (UG892) for more information on Non Project mode.

Arguments:

  -library <arg> - (Optional) The library the VHDL file should reference. The
  default VHDL library is work.

  <file> - (Required) Filename of the VHDL file to be read.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the tool will
  search for the specified file in the current working directory and then in
  the directory from which the tool was launched.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example reads the specified VHDL file and adds it to the
  source fileset:

    read_vhdl C:/Data/FPGA_Design/new_module.vhdl
