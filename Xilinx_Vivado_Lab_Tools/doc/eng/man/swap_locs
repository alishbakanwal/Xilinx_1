Description:

  Swaps the LOC constraints assigned to two similar logic elements. A logic
  element is an element that can be placed onto a device resource on the
  FPGA.

  Some DRC checking is performed when the swap_locs command is executed to
  ensure that the two selected elements can in fact be assigned to their new
  locations. If the location of either element is invalid for any reason, the
  swap_locs command will fail and an error will be returned.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <aloc> - (Required) The location of the first logic element to swap. This
  can be specified as a port, a cell, or a device site.

  <bloc> - (Required) The location of the second logic element to swap. This
  can be specified as a port, a cell, or a device site. This must match the
  type specified by the <aloc> variable.

Examples:

  The following example swaps the instances assigned to the two specified
  device sites:

    swap_locs [get_sites {OLOGIC_X2Y1}] [get_sites {OLOGIC_X2Y0}]
