Description:

  Writes a ChipScope<tm tmtype="tm"/> Definition and Connection (CDC) file
  containing the legacy ICON 1.x and ILA 1.x debug cores, ports, and signals
  defined in the current project. The CDC file stores information about
  source files, destination files, core parameters, and core settings for the
  ChipScope Pro Analyzer.

  Note: The write_chipscope_cdc command only works with ICON 1.x and ILA 1.x
  cores. It does not work with newer ILA 2.x or VIO 2.x (or later) Vivado Lab
  Edition debug cores.

  Legacy ChipScope debug cores can be added to a project through the
  instantiation of ICON 1.x and ILA 1.x cores in a HDL design, and inclusion
  of the corresponding netlist and constraint files to the project.

  You can import this CDC file into the ChipScope Analyzer to automatically
  set up the net names on the ILA core data and trigger ports.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - (Required) The CDC file name to be written.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example writes a CDC file called bft.cdc:

    write_chipscope_cdc bft.cdc

  The written CDC file will include signals to be debugged by ChipScope as
  well as the clock domain for the signals, and other settings appropriate
  for use in ChipScope.
