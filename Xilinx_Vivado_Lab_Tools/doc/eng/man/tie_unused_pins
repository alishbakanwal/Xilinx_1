Description:

  Tie up or down the unconnected pins of cells in the open synthesized or
  implemented design. The command uses an internal process to identify
  whether a pin should be tied up or down.

  This command is intended to tie up or down the unconnected pins of cells
  added to the netlist with the create_cell command.

Arguments:

  -of_objects <args> - (Optional) Tie up or down the unused pins of the
  specified cell objects.

  Note: The -of_objects option requires objects to be specified using the
  get_* commands, such as get_cells or get_pins, rather than specifying
  objects by name. In addition, -of_objects cannot be used with a search
  <pattern>.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Example:

  The following example ties the unused pins of cells up or down, depending
  on their usage:

    tie_unused_pins -of_objects [get_cells cpuEngine]
