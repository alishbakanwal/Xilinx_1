Description:

  Report all timing exceptions applied to setup and hold checks defined by
  timing constraints in the current design, or report the exceptions on the
  specified timing paths.

  Timing exceptions can be defined by timing constraints such as
  set_false_path or set_multicycle_path that change the default assumptions
  for timing paths in the design.

  Note: The set_clock_groups constraint is not reported by the
  report_exception command since it is not a considered a timing exception by
  Vivado timing analysis.

  The exceptions are reported to the standard output by default, but can be
  redirected to a file or to a Tcl string variable.

Arguments:

  -from <args> - (Optional) A list of start points on the timing path to
  report exceptions on.

  -rise_from <args> - (Optional) A list of the start points on the timing
  path to report exceptions on the rising-edge of the path.

  -fall_from <args> - (Optional) A list of the start points on the timing
  path to report exceptions on the falling-edge of the path.

  Note: Using the report_exceptions command with -from/-through/-to options
  only matches timing exceptions that have been defined with the same
  -from/-through/-to command line options. The specified patterns can be
  different but the cell, pin, and port objects must also be the same to be
  reported as an exception.

  -to <args> - (Optional) A list of the end points for the timing path to
  report exceptions on.

  -rise_to <args> - (Optional) A list of the end points on the timing path to
  report exceptions on the rising-edge of the path.

  -fall_to <args> - (Optional) A list of the end points on the timing path to
  report exceptions on the falling-edge of the path.

  -through <args> - (Optional) A list of pins, cell, or nets through which
  the timing path passes.

  -rise_through <args> - (Optional) A list of pins, cell, or nets through
  which the rising-edge timing path passes.

  -fall_through <args> - (Optional) Specifies the list of pins, cell, or nets
  through which the falling-edge timing path passes.

  -ignored - (Optional) Report timing path exceptions in the current design
  that are ignored by the Vivado timing engine. Ignored constraints could be
  the result of an incorrectly defined constraint, or of missing design
  objects.

  -summary - (Optional) Report a summary of all exceptions.

  -coverage - (Optional) Report the coverage of all timing exceptions.

  -ignored_objects - (Optional) Report the startpoints and endpoints that are
  part of timing path exceptions, and ignored by the timing engine.

  -no_header - (Optional) Do not write a header to the report.

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file. By
  default the timing exceptions are reported to the standard output, or the
  Tcl console. The specified file will be overwritten if one already exists,
  unless -append is also specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string rather than
  to the standard output. The Tcl string can be captured by a variable
  definition and parsed or otherwise processed.

  Note: This argument cannot be used with the -file option.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  This example reports all timing exceptions in the current design:

    report_exceptions

  This example reports all timing exceptions ignored or overridden in the
  current design:

    report_exceptions -ignored
