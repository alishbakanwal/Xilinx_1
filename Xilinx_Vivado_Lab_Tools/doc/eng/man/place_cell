Description:

  Places cells onto device resources of the target part. Cells can be placed
  onto specific BEL sites (e.g. SLICE_X49Y60/A6LUT), or into available SLICE
  resources (e.g. SLICE_X49Y60). If you specify the SLICE but not the BEL the
  tool will determine an appropriate BEL within the specified SLICE if one is
  available.

  When placing a cell onto a specified site, the site must not be currently
  occupied, or an error will be returned: "Cannot set site and bel property
  of instances. Site SLICE_X49Y61 is already occupied."

  You can test if a site is occupied by querying the IS_OCCUPIED property of
  a BEL site:

    get_property IS_OCCUPIED [get_bels SLICE_X48Y60/D6LUT]

  Note: The IS_OCCUPIED property of a SLICE only tells you if some of the
  BELs within the SLICE are occupied; not whether or not the SLICE is fully
  occupied.

  This command can be used to place cells, or to move placed cells from one
  site on the device to another site. The command syntax is the same for
  placing an unplaced cell, or moving a placed cell.

  When moving a placed cell, if you specify only the SLICE for the site, the
  tool will attempt to place the cell onto the same BEL site in the new SLICE
  as it currently is placed. For instance moving a cell from the B6LUT, by
  specifying a new SLICE, will cause the tool to attempt to place the cell
  onto the B6LUT in the new SLICE. If this BEL site is currently occupied, an
  error is returned.

  Note: This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it
  fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <cell_site_list> - (Required) Specifies a list of cells and sites as
  {<cell_name> <site> }. The cell name is listed first, followed the BEL site
  or SLICE to place the cell onto. If the site is specified as a SLICE, the
  tool will select an available BEL within the SLICE. Multiple cells can be
  placed onto multiple sites by repeating the cell/site pair multiple times
  as needed:

    {<cell_name1> 
     <site1> <cell_name2>  
    site2> \ 
    <cell_name3> <site3>...  
    cell_nameN> <siteN> }

Examples:

  The following example places the specified cell onto the specified BEL site:

    place_cell div_cntr_reg_inferredi_4810_15889 SLICE_X49Y60/D6LUT

  The following example places the specified cell into the specified SLICE:

    place_cell div_cntr_reg_inferredi_4810_15889 SLICE_X49Y61

  Note: The tool will select an appropriate BEL site if one is available. If
  no BEL is available, and error will be returned.

  The following example places multiple cells onto multiple sites:

    
    place_cell  { \ 
       cpuEngine/cpu_iwb_adr_o/buffer_fifo/i_4810_17734 SLICE_X49Y60/A6LUT \ 
       cpuEngine/or1200_cpu/or1200_mult_mac/i_4775_15857 SLICE_X49Y60/B6LUT \ 
       cpuEngine/cpu_iwb_adr_o/buffer_fifo/xlnx_opt_LUT_i_4810_18807_2 \ 
       SLICE_X49Y60/C6LUT }
