Description:

  Commit the current values of properties defined on the specified memory IP
  debug core hardware objects in the Hardware Manager feature of the Vivado
  Design Suite to the current hardware device.

  The commit_hw_mig command takes the current property values defined on a
  hw_mig object in the Vivado logic analyzer, and commits them to the current
  hardware device connected to the hardware server.

  When you change the property values on the hw_mig object, like the CONFIG.*
  properties, they are not written to the hardware device until you use the
  commit_hw_mig command.

  This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_objects> - (Optional) Inputs can be any hw_mig, hw_device, hw_target,
  or hw_server object. If no object is specified, the current hw_device is
  targeted.

  Note: The objects must be specified using the appropriate get_hw_xxx
  command, for instance get_hw_sysmon, rather than specified by name.

Example:

  The following example commits the current properties on the hw_mig object
  to the current hardware device:

    commit_hw_mig [lindex [get_hw_migs] 0]
