Description:

  Perform DRC check on IP to ensure that it is properly constructed. This
  command returns 1 when all IPs have been validated, or 0 when there is a
  problem.

Arguments:

  -save_ip - (Optional) Updates the existing IP files after validation. No
  new files are created but the XCI and BOM files for the core are updated.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <ips> - (Optional) Specifies the set of IP cores to be validated.

Examples:

  The following example validates the IPs in the current project, and updates
  the persistent representation of the IP.

    validate_ip -save_ip [get_ips]
