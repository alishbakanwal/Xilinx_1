Description:

  Returns a list of port, pin, or cell objects in the fanout of the specified
  sources.

  The all_fanout command is scoped to return objects from current level of
  the hierarchy of the design, either from the top-level or from the level of
  the current instance. By default the current instance is defined as the top
  level of the design, but can be changed by using the current_instance
  command. To return the fanout across all levels of the hierarchy, use the
  -flat option.

Arguments:

  -endpoints_only - (Optional) Find only the timing endpoints. When this
  option is used, none of the intermediate points in the fan-out network are
  returned. This option can be used to identify the primary loads of the
  drivers.

  -flat - (Optional) Ignore the hierarchy of the design. By default, only the
  objects at the same level of hierarchy as the sinks are returned. When
  using this option, all the objects in the fan-out network of the drivers
  are considered, regardless of hierarchy.

  -only_cells - (Optional) Return only the cell objects in the fanout path of
  the specified sources.

  -levels <value> - (Optional) Maximum number of cell levels to traverse. The
  default value is 0.

  -pin_levels <value> - (Optional) Maximum number of pin levels to traverse.
  The default value is 0.

  -trace_arcs <value> - (Optional) Type of network arcs to trace. Valid
  values are "timing", "enabled", and "all"

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <from> - (Required) The source ports, pins, or nets from which to list the
  objects in the fanout path.

Examples:

  The following example gets the fanout for all input ports in the design:

    all_fanout [all_inputs]

  This example gets the fanout for all inputs assigned to I/O Bank 15 in the
  current design:

    all_fanout [filter [all_inputs] {IOBANK == 15}]
