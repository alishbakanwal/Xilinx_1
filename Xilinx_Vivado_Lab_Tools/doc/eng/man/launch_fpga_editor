Description:

  Launches the Xilinx FPGA Editor tool for the active run, or a specified
  run. When the design is open in the FPGA Editor, you can place critical
  elements of the design and examine critical timing pathways. You can also
  cross-probe between the tool and the FPGA Editor using the crossprobe_fed
  command to quickly locate elements of your design in the two editors.

Arguments:

  -run <arg> - (Optional) The run name to use when launching the FPGA Editor.
  The specified run must have a mapped NCD or routed NCD file to launch the
  FPGA Editor.

  -more_options <arg> - (Optional) Additional options to use when invoking
  the FPGA Editor software. For more information, see the online Help
  provided with FPGA Editor.

  -mapped_ncd - (Optional) Use the mapped NCD file as input for FPGA Editor.
  This allows you to view the NCD file output from MAP, without the placement
  and routing data from PAR. You can use this to perform some preplacement
  and routing of critical components if necessary.

  Note: By default the launch_fpga_editor command loads the <design>
  _routed.ncd file, unless this option is specified.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example launches FPGA Editor, specifying the implementation
  run to use and to open the mapped NCD instead of the placed and routed NCD:

    launch_fpga_editor -run impl_4 -mapped_ncd
