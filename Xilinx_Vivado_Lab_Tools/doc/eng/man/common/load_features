Description:

  Load the specified features of the Vivado Design Suite into memory.

  In order to reduce the memory footprint of the Vivado Design Suite, there
  are groups of Tcl commands called "features" which are unavailable for use
  until you run a command from that feature set, or unless you explicitly
  load the feature using the load_features command.

  For example, the load_features simulator command loads the commands for the
  Vivado simulator, as does directly launching the Vivado simulator using the
  launch_xsim command.

  To access the complete list of Tcl commands associated with a feature of
  the Vivado Design Suite, and the help text for these commands, you can load
  the feature into the application memory using the load_features command
  without actually running the feature of the tool.

  You can list the features that are available to be loaded using the
  list_features command. The list of features is dynamic, and changes from
  release to release.

  The command returns nothing if successful, or an error message if failed.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <features> - List of features to load.

Examples:

  The following example loads the Vivado simulator feature:

    load_features simulator

  The following example loads all of the loadable feature sets of the Vivado
  Design Suite:

    load_features [list_features]
