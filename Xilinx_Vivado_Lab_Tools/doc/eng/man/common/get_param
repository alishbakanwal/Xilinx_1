Description:

  This command gets the currently defined value for a specified tool
  parameter. These parameters are user-definable configuration settings that
  control various behaviors within the tool. Refer to report_param for a
  description of what each parameter configures or controls.

Arguments:

  <name> - (Required) The name of the parameter to get the value of. The list
  of user-definable parameters can be obtained with list_param. This command
  requires the full name of the desired parameter. It does not perform any
  pattern matching, and accepts only one parameter at a time.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example returns the current value of the MaxThreads parameter
  used for multi-threaded processes:

    get_param general.MaxThreads
