Description:

  Note: The UNDO and REDO commands are intended for use in the Vivado IDE,
  and are not recommended for use in Tcl scripts to restore designs to a
  former state. To restore a design to a specific condition, you must write a
  design checkpoint using the write_checkpoint command, to be restored using
  read_checkpoint.

  Undo a prior command. This command can be used repeatedly to undo a series
  of commands.

  If a group of commands has been created using the startgroup and endgroup
  commands, this command will undo that group as a sequence. The undo command
  will start at the endgroup command and continue to undo until it hits the
  startgroup command.

  If you undo a command, and then change your mind, you can redo the command.

Arguments:

  -list - (Optional) Reports the list of commands that can be undone. As you
  execute the undo command, the tool will step backward through this list of
  commands.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example returns a list of commands that you can undo:

    undo -list
