Description:

  Register a Tcl procedure (proc) with the Vivado Tcl command interpretor to
  register the command with the Vivado Design Suite help system.

  The following is an example Tcl proc defined for use with the Vivado Design
  Suite:

    proc findCommand {option} { 
      # Summary: 
      # Searches through all Vivado Tcl commands for commands implementing  
      #   the specified argument. 
      # Argument Usage:  
      # option: Specifies the argument to search for.    
      # Return Value: 
      # Returns a list of Tcl commands that implement the option.     
      # Categories: personal 
     
      foreach cmd [lsort [info commands *]]  
      { 
           catch { 
              if {[regexp "$option" [help -syntax $cmd]]}  
      { 
                 puts $cmd 
              } 
           } 
       } 
      } ;  
      # End

  The commented lines beginning with `#` are used to define the help text for
  the registered command in the Vivado Design Suite help system.

   *  # Summary: provides a brief description of the command.

   *  # Argument Usage: provides a list and description of the various
      arguments for the proc.

   *  # Return Value: provides a description of what is returned by the proc.

   *  # Categories: provides an ability to define categories for registered
      procedures.

  After registering the procedure as a Tcl command, the Vivado help system
  will return this text when queried with:

    
    tasknm -help  
    -or- 
    help tasknm

  This command returns the name of the registered proc.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <proc> - (Required) The name of the Tcl procedure loaded into the current
  Vivado Design Suite session. The Tcl proc must be defined and loaded into
  the Vivado Design Suite prior to registration.

  <tasknm> - (Optional) Specify the Tcl command name that wraps the proc, for
  use in the Vivado Design Suite. Default: Register the proc using the root
  name proc.

Example:

  The following example registers a Tcl proc called findCommand as a Tcl
  command named findCmd:

    
    register_proc findCommand findCmd
