Description:

  Deletes ports from Vivado Lab Edition debug cores in the current project.
  You can disconnect a signal from a debug port using disconnect_debug_port,
  or remove the port altogether using this command.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <ports> - (Required) The core_name/port_name of the debug port to be
  removed from the core.

Examples:

  The following example deletes the DATA port from myCore:

    delete_debug_port myCore/DATA

  Note: Some ports cannot be deleted because an ILA port requires one CLK
  port and one TRIG port as a minimum.

  The following example deletes the trigger ports (TRIG) from the myCore
  debug core:

    delete_debug_port [get_debug_ports myCore/TRIG*]

  Note: This example will not delete all TRIG ports from myCore, because an
  ILA core must have at least one TRIG port. The effect of this command will
  be to delete the TRIG ports starting at TRIG0 and removing all of them
  except the last port.
