Description:

  Imports XST synthesis project files into the current project, including the
  various source files used in the XST run.

Arguments:

  -copy_sources - (Optional) Copy XST project source files to the local
  project directory structure rather than referencing them from their current
  location. The default is to reference source files from their current
  location.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - (Required) The name of the XST project file from which to import
  the source files.

Examples:

  The following example creates a new project called xst_test, and imports
  the drp_des.xst file:

    create_project xst_test C:/Data/FPGA_Design/xst_test  
    import_xst C:/Data/ise_designs/drp_des.xst
