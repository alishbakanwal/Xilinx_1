Description:

  Performs a setup and hold check for a data pin with respect to another data
  pin. This is different from a conventional setup and hold check that is
  done with respect to a clock pin.

  This command defines min and max requirements between two endpoints,
  similar to setup (max) and hold (min) timing checks. Setup and hold checks
  are referenced from the related pin, specified by -from, to the constrained
  pin, specified by -to. The related pin is similar to the clock pin in a
  conventional setup and hold check. The timing analysis compares arrival
  times between the two specified endpoints. The difference must be less than
  the set_data_check <value> requirement in order to meet timing.

  Limitations of the set_data_check command include:

   *  Variations in the destination clock delay are ignored.

   *  This command is used for timing purposes only, and is not considered by
      the Vivado placer or router.

  Note: This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it
  fails.

Arguments:

  -from <value> - (Optional) Check the datapath from the specified data pin,
  port, or net. The -from argument specifies the related pin.

  -to <value> - (Optional) Check the datapath to the specified data pin,
  port, or net. The -to argument specifies the constrained pin

  -rise_from <value> - (Optional) Check the datapath from the rising edge of
  the specified data pin, port, or net.

  -fall_from <value> - (Optional) Check the datapath from the falling edge of
  the specified data pin, port, or net.

  -rise_to <value> - (Optional) Check the datapath to the rising edge of the
  specified data pin, port, or net.

  -fall_to <value> - (Optional) Check the datapath to the falling edge of the
  specified data pin, port, or net.

  -setup <value> - (Optional) Perform only the setup data check. The default
  is to perform both setup and hold checks.

  -hold <value> - (Optional) Perform the hold data check. The default is to
  perform both setup and hold checks.

  -clock <value> - (Optional) Specify the clock domain at the related pin or
  port of the checks.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <value> - (Required) The setup or hold time specified in nanoseconds (ns)
  for the defined data checks.

Examples:

  The following example defines a data check for a setup violation from pin
  A_IN to pin C_IN:

    set_data_check -from A_IN -to C_IN -setup 2.0

  In the above example, A_IN is the related pin and C_IN is the constrained
  pin. The above constraint would do a setup check of C_IN with respect to
  A_IN. The data at C_IN should arrive 2.0 ns prior to the edge of A_IN.
