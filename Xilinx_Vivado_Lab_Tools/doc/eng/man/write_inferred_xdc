Description:

  You can use the write_inferred_xdc to find constraints that should be
  defined in the open synthesized or implemented design. Write timing
  constraints that are automatically generated by the Vivado timing engine,
  rather than defined in an existing XDC file and added to the design.

  Run write_inferred_xdc -clocks first to define suggested clock and
  generated clock constraints. The suggested clock constraints will be
  defined with a period of 1 ns. You can edit the recommended constraints to
  create clocks and generated clocks with the required clock period to meet
  the needs of your design.

  You can add the edited constraints file into the design using read_xdc, or
  add_files, and update_timing.

  You may need to run the write_inferred_xdc command multiple times, using
  various options like -clock_groups or -async_clocks, to capture all
  inferred timing constraints from the fully clocked design. You can use an
  iterative process of writing and sourcing the inferred clocked constraints,
  and then writing and sourcing additional constraint files to capture all
  inferred constraints. See the example below for more information.

  This command returns a transcript of the process when successful, or
  returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -force - (Optional) Overwrite the specified output file if it already exists.

  -all - (Optional) Write all XDC constraints for the current design, except
  missing clocks. The missing clocks can be separately obtained using the
  -clocks option.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -async_clocks - (Optional) Find asynchronous clock groups that should be
  defined using the set_clock_groups -asynchronous constraint.

  -clock_groups - (Optional) Find asynchronous and exclusive clock groups,
  equivalent to specifying both the -async_clocks and -excl_clocks options in
  the same command.

  -clocks - (Optional) Find missing clock and generated clock definitions
  that should be defined by the create_clock and create_generated_clock
  constraints.

  Note: This is the default report generated by the write_inferred_xdc
  command when no other constraint options are specified.

  -excl_clocks - (Optional) Find physically and logically exclusive clock
  groups that should be defined using the set_clock_groups
  -physically_exclusive constraint or the set_clock_groups
  -logically_exclusive constraint.

  -exceptions - (Optional) Find missing timing exceptions that should be
  defined by timing constraints such as set_false_path or set_multicycle_path
  that change the default assumptions for timing paths in the design.

  -io_constraints <arg> - (Optional) Find missing I/O constraints such as
  set_input_delay, and set_output_delay.

  -merge_existing_constraints - (Optional) This option reports existing
  user-defined constraints matching the type of inferred constraints
  currently being reported by the write_inferred_xdc command.

  Note: The existing constraints are written to the specified file as
  comments so that the inferred constraints file can be read into the Vivado
  Design Suite using read_xdc without conflicting with existing constraints.

  -name <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the name of the results set to return
  the reported constraints to when running in the Vivado IDE.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - (Required) The filename to write the inferred XDC constraints to.
  You should specify a file extension as part of the file name, as the
  write_inferred_xdc command will not provide one.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example writes the inferred clock constraints in the current
  design:

    write_inferred_xdc -clocks C:/Data/design1_inferred_clocks.xdc

  The write_inferred_xdc command may need to be run multiple times to capture
  all the inferred constraints, as is shown in this example:

    write_inferred_xdc -clocks clocks.xdc 
    source clocks,xdc 
    write_inferred_xdc -all all.xdc 
    source all.xdc 
    write_inferred_xdc -async_clocks async.xdc 
    source async.xdc
