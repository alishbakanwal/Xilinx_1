Description:

  Create a new interface pin on an IP Integrator hierarchical module. An IP
  Integrator interface is a grouping of signals that share a common function,
  and can include both individual signals and buses that share a related
  function. An AXI4-Lite master, for example, is an interface that includes a
  large number of individual signals plus multiple buses.

  To create a single connection pin, or standard bus pin, use the
  create_bd_pin command.

  Interface pins connect with other compatible interface pins, or interface
  ports. The interface pin is added as a port inside the hierarchical module,
  to connect outside of the module, and as a pin on the hierarchical module.

  You must define the hierarchical module as the current instance in the IP
  Integrator subsystem design, using the current_bd_instance command. The
  current instance is the target of the create_bd_intf_pin command.

  This command returns the name of the newly created interface pin object if
  successful, and returns an error if it failed.

Arguments:

  -vlnv <arg> - (Required) The Vendor:Library:Name:Version (VLNV) attribute
  of the interface pin object to be added to the subsystem design. The VLNV
  attribute identifies the object in the IP Integrator catalog.

  Note: The -vlnv property for interface pins and ports refers to files in
  the Vivado Design Suite installation hierarchy. -vlnv
  xilinx.com:interface:lmb_rtl:1.0 for example, is located in the Vivado
  Design Suite installation at data/ip/interfaces/lmb_v1_0.

  -mode <arg> - (Required) Defines the mode of the interface pin. Accepted
  values are Master, Slave, System, MirroredMaster, MirroredSlave,
  MirroredSystem, Monitor.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) The name of the interface pin to add to the current
  instance.

Example:

  The following example sets the hierarchical module, newMod1, as the current
  instance of the IP integrator subsystem design, and then creates a new
  interface pin on that module:

    current_bd_instance [get_bd_cells /newMod1] 
    create_bd_intf_pin -mode Slave -vlnv xilinx.com:user:dma_rtl:1.0 data_in
