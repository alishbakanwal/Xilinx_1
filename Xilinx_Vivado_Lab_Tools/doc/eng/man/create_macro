Description:

  Create a macro for the relative placement of cells.

  Macros are primarily used to place small groups of associated cells
  together to improve resource efficiency and enable faster interconnections.
  The create_macro command lets you define macros in an open synthesized or
  implemented design for relative placement by place_design, like RPMs
  defined by the RLOC constraint in RTL source files. Refer to the Vivado
  Design Suite User Guide: Implementation (UG904) for more information on
  defining relatively placed macros.

  After creating the macro, specific cells can be assigned to the macro using
  the update_macro command. To change a currently defined macro, you must
  delete the macro with delete_macro, recreate the macro, and update the
  macro with the new contents. You cannot simply overwrite an existing macro.

  Use delete_macro to delete a defined macro. Use get_macros to return a list
  of currently defined macros in the design.

  This command operates silently and does not return anything.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) Specify the name of the macro to create.

Examples:

  The following example creates a macro called :

    create_macro usbMacro1
