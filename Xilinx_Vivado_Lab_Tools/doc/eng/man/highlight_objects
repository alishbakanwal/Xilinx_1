Description:

  Highlights the specified or selected object or objects in a color as
  determined by one of the available color options.

  Note: Only one of the available color option should be used to specify the
  highlight color. However, if more than one color option is used, the order
  of precedence to define the color is -rgb, -color_index, and -color.

  Selected objects are automatically unselected in order to display the
  objects in the specified highlight color. Objects can be unhighlighted with
  the unhighlight_objects command.

Arguments:

  -color_index arg - (Optional) Valid values are integers from 1 to 20.
  Specifies the color index to use for highlighting the selected object or
  objects. The color index is defined by the Highlight category of the Tools
  > Options > Themes command. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide:
  Using the IDE (UG893) for more information on setting themes.

  -rgb args - (Optional) The color to use in the form of an RGB code
  specified as {R G B}. For instance, {255 255 0} specifies the color yellow.

  -color arg - (Optional) The color to use for highlighting the specified
  object or objects. Supported highlight colors are: red, green, blue,
  magenta, yellow, cyan, and orange.

  Note: White is the color used to display selected objects with the
  select_objects command.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - (Required) Specifies one or more objects to be highlighted.

Examples:

  The following example highlights the currently selected objects in the
  color red:

    highlight_objects -color red [get_selected_objects]
