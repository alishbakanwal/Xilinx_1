Description:

  Create a hw_cfgmem object associated with the specified hw_device.

  The process whereby the bitstream data is loaded or programmed into the
  Xilinx<tm tmtype="reg"/> FPGA is called configuration. Configuration is
  designed to be flexible to accommodate different application needs and,
  wherever possible, to leverage existing system resources to minimize system
  costs.

  Xilinx FPGAs are configured by loading design-specific configuration data,
  in the form of a bitstream file, into the internal memory of the hw_device.
  The hw_cfgmem defines a flash memory device used for configuring and
  booting the Xilinx FPGA device. Once the hw_cfgmem object is created, and
  associated with the hw_device, the configuration memory can be programmed
  with the bitstream and other data using the program_hw_cfgmem command.

  The hw_cfgmem object is associated with the specified hw_device object
  through the PROGRAM.HW_CFGMEM property on the device object. Use the
  get_hw_cfgmems command to work with the hw_cfgmem object, or use the
  get_property command to obtain the object from the hw_device:

    get_property PROGRAM.HW_CFGMEM [current_hw_device]

  Note: When creating a new hw_cfgmem object, you can also associate the
  object with a Tcl variable as shown in the example below. By referring to
  the variable, you can set properties on the object, and use the object with
  other Tcl commands like program_hw_cfgmem or readback_hw_cfgmem.

  This command returns the created hw_cfgmem object, or returns an error if
  it fails.

Arguments:

  -hw_device <arg> - (Required) Specify the hw_device object to associate the
  memory configuration device with. The hw_device must be specified as an
  object as returned by the get_hw_devices command or current_hw_device
  command.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <mem_device> - (Required) Specify the flash memory device to use for
  configuring the associated hw_device. The configuration memory must be
  specified as a cfgmem_part object object using the get_cfgmem_parts
  command.

  Note: The COMPATIBLE_PARTS property of the cfgmem_part object identifies
  which Xilinx devices a configuration memory is compatible with.

Example:

  The following example:

   *  Gets the PART associated with the current_hw_device.

   *  Gets a list of cfgmem_parts that are compatible with the device part.

   *  Uses one of the compatible parts to create a new hw_cfgmem object.

   *  Sets the PROGRAM.FILE property of the current hw_cfgmem object to the
      cfgmem file created with the write_cfgmem command.

   *  Programs the current hw_cfgmem object.

    set devPart [get_property PART [current_hw_device]] 
    set cfgParts [get_cfgmem_parts -of [get_parts $devPart]] 
    create_hw_cfgmem -hw_device [current_hw_device] [lindex $cfgParts 0 ] 
    set_property PROGRAM.FILE {C:/Data/cfgmem_file.mcs} [current_hw_cfgmem] 
    program_hw_cfgmem [current_hw_cfgmem]
