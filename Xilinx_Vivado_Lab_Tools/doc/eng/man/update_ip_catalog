Description:

  Update the IP Catalog associated with the current design.

  The Xilinx<tm tmtype="reg"></tm> IP catalog, or repository, is located in
  the installation hierarchy of the Vivado Design Suite software release
  being used. You can also add custom IP to the repository by using the
  set_property command to set the IP_REPO_PATHS property on the source
  fileset to point to the locations of custom IP, as shown in the example
  below.

  The update_ip_catalog command lets you add, delete, disable, or enable
  individual IP cores in the catalog. When referring to individual cores, you
  can reference them by the path to the component.xml file, or by referencing
  the VLNV property of the IP.

  Note: The VLNV property refers to the Vendor:Library:Name:Version string
  which uniquely identifies the IP in the catalog.

  This command returns a transcript of its process if successful, or returns
  an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -rebuild - (Optional) Rebuild the complete IP Catalog index, or just
  rebuild the index for the IP repository specified by the -repo_path .

  -add_ip <arg> - (Optional) Add an individual IP core to the specified IP
  repository. This argument requires the -repo_path argument to also be
  specified. The IP is specified as a path to the component.xml of the IP, or
  the path to a zip file containing the IP.

  -delete_ip <arg> - (Optional) Remove an IP core from the specified IP
  repository. This argument requires the -repo_path argument to also be
  specified. The IP is specified as a path to the component.xml of the IP, or
  as the VLNV property of the IP.

  -delete_mult_ip <arg> - (Optional) Remove the specified IP cores from the
  IP repository. This argument requires the -repo_path argument to also be
  specified. The IPs are specified either as paths to the component.xml
  files, or as the VLNV properties of the IP.

  -disable_ip <arg> - (Optional) Disable an IP core from the specified IP
  repository. This argument requires the -repo_path argument to also be
  specified. The IP is specified as a path to the component.xml of the IP, or
  as the VLNV property of the IP.

  -enable_ip <arg> - (Optional) Enable a previously disabled IP core from the
  specified repository. This argument requires the -repo_path argument to
  also be specified. The IP is specified as a path to the component.xml of
  the IP, or as the VLNV property of the IP.

  -add_interface <arg> - (Optional) Specify the path to the XML file of a
  user-defined AXI interface to add to the IP repository.

  -create_index - (Optional) Cache the specified repository`s data on disk,
  to improve load time. This argument requires the -repo_path argument to
  also be specified.

  -repo_path <arg> - (Optional) Used in conjunction with -rebuild, -add_ip,
  -delete_ip, -delete_mult_ip or -create_index to specify the directory name
  of an IP repository to operate on.

  Note: The IP repository must have been previously added to the current
  source fileset using the set_property command to set the IP_REPO_PATH. See
  the example below.

  -update_module_ref - (Optional) Refresh the block design cell or cells that
  reference module definitions from RTL source files by rereading a module
  definition from the source file.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example sets the IP_REPO_PATHS property of the current Source
  fileset, to add an IP repository, then rebuilds the IP catalog index for
  the whole IP catalog:

    set_property IP_REPO_PATHS C:/Data/IP_LIB [current_fileset] 
    update_ip_catalog -rebuild

  This example disables the IP specified by its VLNV property from the
  specified IP repository:

    
    update_ip_catalog -disable_ip {myCo.com:ip:custom_decoder:1.0} \ 
       -repo_path C:/Data/ip

  This example disables the IP specified by the path to the component.xml
  file, from the IP repository:

    
    update_ip_catalog -disable_ip C:/Data/ip/custom_encoder_1/component.xml \ 
    -repo_path C:/Xilinx/Vivado/data/ip
