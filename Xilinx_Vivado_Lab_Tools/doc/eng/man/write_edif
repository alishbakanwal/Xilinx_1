Description:

  Writes the current netlist as an EDIF file, or outputs the contents of
  specific Pblocks or hierarchical cells as EDIF netlist files.

  In the case of either the -pblocks or -cell option being used, this
  argument specifies a directory name where the EDIF netlist files for each
  Pblock or cell will be written. The EDIF netlist file will be named after
  the Pblock or cell. If the directory specified does not exist, the tool
  will return an error.

Arguments:

  -pblocks <arg> - (Optional) Instructs the tool to output the contents of
  the specified Pblocks as EDIF netlist files. The contents of each Pblock
  will be written to a separate EDIF file. These files can be added as design
  source files to netlist projects, but are not intended to be read into a
  design using update_design. Use the -cell option to write EDIF netlists for
  use with update_design.

  -cell <arg> - (Optional) Instructs the tool to output the contents of the
  specified hierarchical cell as EDIF netlist files. Only one cell can be
  specified for output.

  Note: The -pblocks and -cell options are mutually exclusive. Although they
  are optional arguments, only one can be specified at one time.

  -force - (Optional) Overwrite the EDIF file if it already exists.

  -security_mode [ multifile | all ] - (Optional) Write a multiple EDIF files
  when encrypted IP is found in the design, or write a single file.

   *  multifile - This is the default setting. By default the command writes
      out the full design netlist to the specified file. However, if the
      design contains secured IP, it creates an encrypted file containing the
      contents of the secured module. This will result in the output of
      multiple EDIF files, containing secured and unsecured elements of the
      design.

   *  all - Write both encrypted and unencrypted cells to a single specified
      file.

  -logic_function_stripped - (Optional) Hides the INIT values for LUTs & RAMs
  by converting them to fixed values in order to create a netlist for debug
  purposes that will not behave properly in simulation or synthesis.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - (Required) The filename of the EDIF file to write. The default
  file extension for an EDIF netlist is .edn. If the -pblocks or -cell
  options are used, the name specified here refers to a directory rather than
  a single file.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example writes an EDIF netlist file for the whole design to
  the specified file name:

    write_edif C:/Data/edifOut.edn

  The following example outputs an EDIF netlist for all Pblocks in the
  design. The files will be written to the specified directory.

    write_edif -pblocks [get_pblocks] C:/Data/FPGA_Design/
