Description:

  Gets the number of messages that will be reported by the tool while
  invoked. When the tool reaches the defined message limit, it stops
  reporting messages. The default value is 4,294,967,295. This default value
  can be changed with the set_msg_limit command.

  Every message delivered by the tool has a unique global message ID that
  consists of an application sub-system code and a message identifier. This
  results in a message ID that looks like the following:

    "Common 17-54" 
    "Netlist 29-28" 
    "Synth 8-3295"

Arguments:

  -id <arg> - (Optional) The message ID to return the limit of. For example,
  "Common 17-54" or "Netlist 29-28".

  -severity <value> - (Optional) Specifies the severity of the message. There
  are five message severities:

   *  ERROR - An ERROR condition implies an issue has been encountered which
      will render design results unusable and cannot be resolved without user
      intervention.

   *  {CRITICAL WARNING} - A CRITICAL WARNING message indicates that certain
      input/constraints will either not be applied or are outside the best
      practices for a FPGA family. User action is strongly recommended.

      Note: Since this is a two word value, it must be enclosed in {}.

   *  WARNING - A WARNING message indicates that design results may be
      sub-optimal because constraints or specifications may not be applied as
      intended. User action may be taken or may be reserved.

   *  INFO - An INFO message is the same as a STATUS message, but includes a
      severity and message ID tag. An INFO message includes a message ID to
      allow further investigation through answer records if needed.

   *  STATUS - A STATUS message communicates general status of the process
      and feedback to the user regarding design processing. A STATUS message
      does not include a message ID.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example returns the limit for CRITICAL WARNING messages:

    get_msg_limit -severity {CRITICAL WARNING}

  The default when -severity or -id is not specified is to return the limit
  for all messages.

  The following example returns the message limit of the specified message ID:

    get_msg_limit -id "Netlist 29-28"
