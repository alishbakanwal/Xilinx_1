Description:

  Remove specified breakpoints from the current simulation. You must have an
  open simulation to use this command.

  A breakpoint is a user-determined stopping point in the source code used
  for debugging the design. When simulating a design with breakpoints,
  simulation of the design stops at each breakpoint to let you examine values
  and verify the design behavior.

  The breakpoints in the current simulation can be reported using the
  report_bps command.

  This command returns nothing, or an error if the command fails.

Arguments:

  -all - (Optional) Remove all breakpoints in the current simulation.

  Note: This option will remove ALL breakpoints without warning, even if
  other options are specified.

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Remove an existing breakpoint in the specified HDL
  source file.

  -line <arg> - (Optional) Remove an existing breakpoint at the specified
  line number of the HDL source file.

  Note: Both -file and -line must be used together to define an existing
  breakpoint.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <BreakPointObjsOrIds> - (Optional) Specifies one or more breakpoint objects
  in the current simulation to remove. The breakpoint object is returned by
  the add_bp command when the breakpoint is added to the simulation.

Examples:

  The following example removes all the breakpoints in the current simulation:

    remove_bps -all
