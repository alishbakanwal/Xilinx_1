Description:

  Specifies the external system-level path delay on a primary output port
  relative to a clock edge at the interface of the design. The output delay
  value is specified in nanoseconds (ns), and can be positive or negative,
  depending on the clock and data relative phase outside the FPGA device.

  To accurately model the system-level timing of your Xilinx FPGA design, you
  must assign timing delays for objects external to the FPGA onto the primary
  input or output ports in your design. These delays are defined by the
  set_input_delay and set_output_delay commands.

  Note: If the output port also has a set_max_delay constraint assigned, the
  specified input delay value is considered part of the max_delay
  computation. That is, the output delay consumes a portion of the max delay
  on the timing path that includes the output port.

  This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -clock <arg> - (Optional) Indicates that the delay is relative to the
  rising edge of the specified clock.

  -reference_pin <arg> - (Optional) Specifies that the delay is relative to
  the specified pin rather than a clock.

  -clock_fall - (Optional) Specifies that the delay is relative to a falling
  edge of the clock rather than rising edge.

  -rise - (Optional) Specifies that the delay is for a rising edge.

  -fall - (Optional) Specifies that the delay is for a falling edge

  -max - (Optional) Specifies that the delay specified should be treated as a
  maximum threshold.

  -min - (Optional) Specifies that the delay specified should be treated as a
  minimum threshold.

  -add_delay - (Optional) Specifies that the delay specified should be added
  to any existing delay on the path rather than replacing the existing delay.

  -network_latency_included - (Optional) Indicates that the clock network
  latency of the reference clock is included in the delay value. The Vivado
  timing engine considers the clock edge reaching the capture flop after the
  clock latencies unless the specified input or output delay value includes
  the source latency or network latency.

  -source_latency_included - (Optional) Specifies that the source latency of
  the reference clock is included in the specified delay value.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <delay> - (Optional) The delay specified in nanoseconds (ns) to apply to
  the listed ports. Valid values are floating point numbers, with a default
  value of 0.

  <objects> - (Required) A list of ports to which the delay applies.

Examples:

  The following example sets an output delay on ports relative to the
  specified clock:

    set_output_delay 5.0 -clock [get_clocks cpuClk] [get_ports]

  The next example is the same as the prior example except that network
  latency is now included:

    set_output_delay 5.0 -clock [get_clocks cpuClk] \ 
       -network_latency_included [get_ports]
