Description:

  Run a serial I/O analyzer link sweep scan to run multiple scans across a
  range of values.

  To analyze the margin of a given link, it is often helpful to run a scan of
  the link using the specialized features of Xilinx UltraScale devices or 7
  Series FPGAs. It can also be helpful to run multiple scans on a the link
  with different configuration settings for the GTs. This can help you
  determine which settings are best for your design. The Vivado serial I/O
  analyzer feature enables you to define, run, and save link sweeps, or
  collections of link scans run across a range of values.

  This command run analysis on the specified sweep scan objects. If running
  in a Tcl script, you can suspend the script while the sweep scan completes
  using the wait_on_hw_sio_sweep command. You can stop a running sweep scan
  using the stop_hw_sio_sweep command.

  You can save the sweep scan to disk using the write_hw_sio_sweep command.

  You can remove the created scan object using remove_hw_sio_sweep.

  This command returns the hw_sio_sweep object, or returns an error if the
  command fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_sio_sweeps> - (Required) Specify one or more hw_sio_sweep objects to
  run. The hw_sio_sweep must be specified as an object as returned by the
  get_hw_sio_sweeps command.

Example:

  The following example runs the specified sweep scan:

    run_hw_sio_sweep [lindex [get_hw_sio_sweeps {SWEEP_0}] 0]
