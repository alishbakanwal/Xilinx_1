Description:

  Removes the specified ports or busses.

  The remove_port command will remove ports that have been added with the
  create_port command, but cannot delete ports that are defined in the RTL or
  netlist design.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <ports> - One or more names of ports to remove.

Examples:

  The following example deletes the specified port:

    remove_port PORT0

  The following example deletes the two specified ports of a bus:

    remove_port BUS[1] BUS[2]

  The following example deletes both the N and P sides of a differential pair
  port:

    remove_port D_BUS_P[0]

  Note: Deleting either the N or the P side of a differential pair will also
  delete the other side of the pair.
