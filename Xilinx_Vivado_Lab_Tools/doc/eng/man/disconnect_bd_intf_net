Description:

  Disconnect a single interface net in the IP Integrator subsystem design
  from the specified objects. An interface is a grouping of signals that
  share a common function in the IP Integrator subsystem design.

  This command lets you disconnect the specified interface net from pins or
  ports in the IP subsystem design, without deleting the whole net. To delete
  the whole net, you should use the delete_bd_objs command.

  This command returns TCL_OK is successful, or TCL_ERROR if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <intf_net> - (Required) Specifies a single interface net in the IP
  subsystem design to disconnect from the specified objects. The net can be
  specified by name, or as a single object returned by the get_bd_intf_nets
  command.

  <objects> - (Required) The list of interface pin or port objects to
  disconnect the net from. The interface pins and ports must be specified as
  design objects returned by the get_bd_intf_pins or get_bd_intf_ports
  commands. They cannot simply be referenced by name.

Example:

  The following example disconnects the only interface net in the IP
  subsystem design, from all interface pin and port objects that are
  connected to it:

    disconnect_bd_intf_net [get_bd_intf_nets] \ 
    [get_bd_intf_pins -of_objects [get_bd_intf_nets]] \ 
    [get_bd_intf_ports -of_objects [get_bd_intf_nets]]

  Note: In this example you know there is only one interface net in the
  design, or an error would be returned by the disconnect_bd_intf_net
  command, which only accepts a single interface net.
