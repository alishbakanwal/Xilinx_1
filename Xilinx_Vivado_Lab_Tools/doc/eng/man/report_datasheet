Description:

  Create a "datasheet" report for the current design. Reports setup and hold
  times of input I/Os in relation to clocks, max/min delays from clocks to
  output pads, skews of input/ output buses.

  The datasheet report has the timing characteristics of a design at the
  package balls/pads, including the package trace flight times. To disable
  flight times use the following command:

    config_timing_analysis -disable_flight_delays true

  The source synchronous output skew can be automatically calculated by the
  Vivado Design Suite by using the -group switch for report_datasheet and
  grouping together all the ports of the data bus including the sourced clock
  output port. The sourced clock output port must be first in the group list.
  For example:

    report_datasheet -file output_filename -group [get_ports \ 
       {clock_port data_bit[0] data_bit[1] data_bit[2]}]

Arguments:

  -significant_digits <arg> - (Optional) Number of digits to display from 0
  to 3. The default is 3.

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file. The
  specified file will be overwritten if one already exists, unless -append is
  also specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string rather than
  to the standard output. The Tcl string can be captured by a variable
  definition and parsed or otherwise processed.

  Note: This argument cannot be used with the -file option.

  -sort_by [ port | clock ] - (Optional) Sorting order. Valid values are
  clock or port. The default is to sort the report by clocks.

  -name <arg> - (Optional) The name of the Datasheet report view to display
  in the Vivado IDE when run in GUI mode. If the name has already been used
  in an open Report view, that view will be closed and a new report opened.

  -show_all_corners - (Optional) Report all process corners.

  -show_oe_timing - (Optional) Report max and min values for paths using
  output enable, showing both ON and OFF states.

  -group [get_ports {xxx1 xxx2 ... xxxN}] - (Optional) Allows you to define
  your own custom group of ports for analysis. This option requires a list of
  port objects as returned by the get_ports command. The first port in the
  list will be used as the reference for skew calculation. In most cases,
  this will be a clock port of a source synchronous output interface.
  Multiple groups can be specified, each with its own reference clock port.
  When -group is not specified the timer automatically finds the group of
  output ports based on the launching clock, and reports skew based on that
  clock.

  -rpx <arg> - (Optional) Specify the file name and path of an Xilinx report
  file (RPX) to write. This is different from writing the report results to a
  file using the -file argument. The RPX file is an interactive report that
  contains all the report information and can be reloaded into memory in the
  Vivado Design Suite using the open_report command. You should add a .rpx
  file extension to the specified file name, as the Vivado tool will not
  automatically assign a file extension.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example returns the datasheet sorted by ports, for all
  process corners:

    
    report_datasheet -sort_by port -show_all_corners

  The following example reports the datasheet with the skew calculation for
  two groups of ports, with the first port of each group providing the
  reference for the skew calculation for that group. In this example, CLK0OUT
  is the forwarded clock for DATA0-4 and CLK1OUT is the forwarded clock for
  DATA4-7:

    report_datasheet -file ds.txt -group [get_ports \ 
       {CLK0OUT DATA0 DATA1 DATA2 DATA3}] \ 
       -group [get_ports {CLK1OUT DATA4 DATA5 DATA6 DATA7}]
