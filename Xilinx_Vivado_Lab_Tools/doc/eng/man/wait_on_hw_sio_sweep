Description:

  Suspend a Tcl script or Tcl command processing until the serial I/O
  analyzer sweep scan is complete.

  This command is used after the run_hw_sio_sweep command to pause Tcl
  processing to wait for the sweep scan to complete. When the
  wait_on_sio_sweep command returns, the Tcl command or script processing can
  continue.

  This command operates silently, returning nothing if successful, or
  returning an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -timeout <arg> - (Optional) Wait for this period of time for the serial I/O
  analyzer sweep scan to complete. If the timeout interval is reached, the
  wait command is terminated.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_sio_sweeps> - (Required) Specify one or more hw_sio_sweep objects to
  wait on. The hw_sio_sweep must be specified as an object as returned by the
  create_hw_sio_sweep or get_hw_sio_sweeps commands.

Example:

  The following example launches an SIO sweep scan and waits for the sweep to
  complete:

    run_hw_sio_sweep [lindex [get_hw_sio_sweeps {SWEEP_0}] 0] 
    wait_on_hw_sio_sweep [lindex [get_hw_sio_sweeps {SWEEP_0}] 0]
