Description:

  Resets the attributes of the switching activity on specified nets, ports,
  pins, and cells in the design.

  The switching activity is defined using the set_switching_activity command.
  The current switching activity defined for a specific port, pin, net, or
  cell can be found by using the report_switching_activity command.

  Note: The reset_switching_activity is used to reset switching activity for
  specified objects. Use set_switching_activity -default_toggle_rate or
  -default_static_probability to change or reset the default values for the
  current design.

  This command operates silently and does not return direct feedback of its
  operation.

Arguments:

  -default - (Optional) Reset the static probability and signal rate of the
  specified object.

  -type <arg> - (Optional) Reset the switching activity for the specified
  type of logic entity. By default, the command is applied to the top-level
  of the current design, or to the specified <objects>. The -type option
  applies the command to the specified type of logic objects in the top-level
  of the current design. The -all option, or -hier option, can be used to
  modify the scope of objects the command applies to. Valid logic types
  include:

   *  io_output - Primary outputs.

   *  io_bidir_enable - Enable pin of Bidir ports.

   *  register - All register outputs in the design/hierarchy specified.

   *  lut - All LUT outputs in the design/hierarchy specified.

   *  lut_ram - All distributed ram outputs in the design/hierarchy specified.

   *  dsp - All DSP outputs in the design/hierarchy specified.

   *  bram_enable - Enable pins (ENARDEN/ENBWREN) of BRAMs.

   *  bram_wr_enable - Write enables of BRAMs (WEA/WEBWE).

   *  gt_txdata - Output TX data pins of all GTs.

   *  gt_rxdata - Output RX data pins of all GTs.

  -hier - (Optional) Reset the switching activity across all levels of the
  specified hierarchical object. Without -hier, the switching activity is
  applied to the specified <objects> at the current level of the hierarchy.

  -all - (Optional) Must be used with -type, reset the switching activity on
  nets within all instances of the specified -type of logic object.

  -no_deassert_resets - (Optional) Disables the -deassert_resets option if it
  was previously enabled using set_switching_activity.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - (Optional) The list of objects for which to reset the switching
  activity. If not specified, the command resets the switching activity on
  all objects.

Examples:

  The following example resets the signal_rate and static probability value
  on all output ports:

    reset_switching_activity -default [all_outputs]
