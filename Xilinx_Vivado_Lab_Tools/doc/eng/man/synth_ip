Description:

  This command is used in the non-project flow to create a synthesized design
  checkpoint file (DCP) to support the out-of-context (OOC) IP flow, or to
  synthesize and implement an IP module in the OOC hierarchical design flow.
  IP objects are specified by the get_ips command, or for the specified IP
  core file (XCI) as specified by the get_files command.

  Note: To enable this functionality, the IP core must be marked for OOC
  generation by setting the GENERATE_SYNTH_CHECKPOINT property to true (or 1)
  using the set_property command on the XCI file.

  For project-based designs you would use the create_ip_run and launch_runs
  commands. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Design Flows
  Overview (UG892) for more information on Project and Non-Project Modes in
  Vivado.

  The synth_ip command will automatically generate any required target files
  prior to synthesizing the IP core. The source files required to synthesize
  the IP are copied into the IP run directory. Upon completion, any newly
  generated OOC target files (dcp, stub files, funcsim netlists...) are
  registered with the associated IP core.

Arguments:

  -force - (Optional) Force re-synthesis of the specified IP objects, even if
  the generated output products for the specified IP are all current.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - (Required) One or more IP objects to synthesize. The objects
  can be specified as IP cores by the get_ips command, or as XCI files using
  the get_files command.

Examples:

  The following example synthesizes the specified IP object, regenerating the
  netlist if the synthesized core is up-to-date:

    synth_ip [get_ips char_fifo] -force
