Description:

  Analyzes a Design Checkpoint (.dcp) file to determine if the loaded design
  and specified checkpoint are sufficiently correlated to make using the
  placement and routing data from the checkpoint beneficial to guide
  placement or routing.

  Placement and routing can be guided from a previously placed and routed
  Design Checkpoint through the use of the -guide option in the place_design
  or route_design commands.

  A low correlation between the current design and the checkpoint should
  discourage using the checkpoint as a guide.

Arguments:

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file. The
  specified file will be overwritten if one already exists, unless -append is
  also specified. By default, the report will be written to the Tcl console.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - Append the output of the command to the specified file rather
  than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <dcp_file> - The path and filename of the checkpoint file.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the tool will
  search for the specified file in the current working directory and then in
  the directory from which the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example reports the correlation of the specified checkpoint
  to the current design:

    report_guidance C:/Data/checkpoint_1.dcp
