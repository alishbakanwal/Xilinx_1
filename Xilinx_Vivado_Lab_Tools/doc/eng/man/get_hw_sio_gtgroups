Description:

  Returns the groups of GTs, hw_sio_gtgroups, as they relate to the quads
  that are in use on the IBERT debug core on the current hardware device.

  GT groups, relate to the IO Banks on the hardware device, with the number
  of available banks and GT pins determined by the target device. On the
  Kintex-7 xc7k325 part, for example, there are four quads, each containing
  four differential GT pins, and two differential REFCLK pins. Each GT pin
  has its own transmitter, TX, and receiver, RX. Quads can also include one
  shared PLL per quad, or Quad PLL. The quads are defined on the IBERT debug
  core, and can be customized with a number of user settings when the IBERT
  is added into the RTL design. Refer to the LogiCORE IP Integrated Bit Error
  Ratio Tester (IBERT) for 7 Series GTX Transceivers v3.0 (PG132)or to 7
  Series FPGAs GTX/GTH Transceivers User Guide (UG476) or UltraScale
  Architecture GTH Transceivers User Guide (UG576) for more information.

  This command returns a list of GT group objects on the IBERT debug core, or
  returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -of_objects <arg> - (Optional) Return the hw_sio_gtgroup objects of the
  specified hw_server, hw_target, hw_device, hw_sio_ibert, hw_sio_common,
  hw_sio_pll, hw_sio_gt, hw_sio_tx, or hw_sio_rx. The objects must be
  specified using the appropriate get_hw_* command.

  Note: The -of_objects option requires objects to be specified using the
  get_* commands, such as get_cells or get_pins, rather than specifying
  objects by name. In addition, -of_objects cannot be used with a search
  <pattern>.

  -regexp - (Optional) Specifies that the search <patterns> are written as
  regular expressions. Both search <patterns> and -filter expressions must be
  written as regular expressions when this argument is used. Xilinx regular
  expression Tcl commands are always anchored to the start of the search
  string. You can add ".*" to the beginning or end of a search string to
  widen the search to include a substring. See
  http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html for help with regular expression
  syntax.

  Note: The Tcl built-in command regexp is not anchored, and works as a
  standard Tcl command. For more information refer to
  http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/regexp.htm.

  -nocase - (Optional) Perform case-insensitive matching when a pattern has
  been specified. This argument applies to the use of -regexp only.

  -filter <args> - (Optional) Filter the results list with the specified
  expression. The -filter argument filters the list of objects returned by
  get_hw_sio_gtgroups based on property values on the GT group objects. You
  can find the properties on an object with the report_property or
  list_property commands. In the case of the "hw_sio_gtgroup" object,
  "DISPLAY_NAME" and "GT_TYPE" are two of the properties that can be used to
  filter results.

  The filter search pattern should be quoted to avoid having to escape
  special characters that may be found in net, pin, or cell names, or other
  properties. String matching is case-sensitive and is always anchored to the
  start and to the end of the search string. The wildcard "*" character can
  be used at the beginning or at the end of a search string to widen the
  search to include a substring of the property value.

  Note: The filter returns an object if a specified property exists on the
  object, and the specified pattern matches the property value on the object.
  In the case of the "*" wildcard character, this will match a property with
  a defined value of "".

  For string comparison, the specific operators that can be used in filter
  expressions are "equal" (==), "not-equal" (!=), "match" (=~), and
  "not-match" (!~). Numeric comparison operators <, >, <=, and >= can also be
  used. Multiple filter expressions can be joined by AND and OR (&& and ||).
  The following gets input pins that do NOT contain the "RESET" substring
  within their name:

    get_pins * -filter {DIRECTION == IN && NAME !~ "*RESET*"}

  Boolean (bool) type properties can be directly evaluated in filter
  expressions as true or not true:

    -filter {IS_PRIMITIVE && !IS_LOC_FIXED}

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <patterns> - (Optional) Match hw_sio_gtgroup objects against the specified
  patterns. The default pattern is the wildcard `*` which gets a list of all
  hw_sio_gtgroups available on the current hardware device.

Example:

  The following example gets the ILA debug cores defined on the current
  hardware device:

    
    get_hw_sio_gtgroups -of [get_hw_sio_gts *MGT_X0Y9]
