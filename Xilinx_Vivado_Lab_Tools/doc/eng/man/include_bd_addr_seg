Description:

  Reverses the exclusion of an AXI peripheral address segment from access by
  the AXI master, and restores the address segment to a mapped state.

  In the block design, address segments of AXI peripherals can have one of
  three states:

   *  Unmapped - An AXI peripheral, or slave interface, is connected to an
      AXI master, but the peripheral has not been assigned an address segment
      in the master's address space and is not visible to the master.

   *  Mapped - The AXI peripheral is mapped into the AXI master`s address
      space, assigned an address segment or range, and is accessible through
      the master.

   *  Excluded - The AXI peripheral is mapped to the AXI master, and has been
      assigned an address segment, but is not accessible to the master. The
      address segment that the AXI slave occupies within the master address
      space is also considered filled.

  The exclude_bd_addr_seg command lets you exclude specific address segments
  from access by the AXI master they are mapped to. The include_bd_addr_seg
  restores access to the mapped address segment.

  This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it failed.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <segment_to_include> - A single address segment object, bd_addr_seg, to
  restore to the AXI master address space.

Example:

  The following example restores the AXI peripheral address segment for
  access by its AXI master:

    include_bd_addr_seg [get_bd_addr_segs microblaze_1/Data/SEG_axi_gpio_1_Reg]
