Description:

  Imports an NCD and an optional TWX into an implementation run in the
  current project. This command is one of the steps involved in importing a
  previously placed and routed design from ISE into the tool.

Arguments:

  -run <arg> - (Optional) The name of the implementation run to be imported
  into.

  Note: This command does not create a run, but rather imports the required
  NCD file, and an optional TWX file if specified, into the specified run and
  sets its state to implemented.

  -twx <arg> - (Optional) The path and file name of an optional TRACE Timing
  file (.TWX) which can be imported along with the placement and routing data
  found in the .NCD file.

  -pcf <arg> - (Optional) A Physical Constraint File to load. Logical
  constraints in the NGD file are read by MAP. MAP uses some of the
  constraints to map the design and converts logical constraints to physical
  constraints and writes them to a Physical Constraints File (PCF).

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <ncd> - The path and name of the NCD file to import into the specified
  implementation run.

Examples:

  The following example creates a new empty RTL source project; changes the
  design_mode property to GateLvl, or netlist entry project; specifies the
  EDIF file representing the top-module of the design; and finally imports an
  NCD file into the implementation run which was initially created with the
  project.

    create_project myProject C:/Data/myProject 
    set_property design_mode GateLvl [current_fileset]  
    set_property edif_top_file C:/Data/ise/drp_des/drp_demo.ngc [current_fileset] 
    import_as_run -run impl_1 C:/Data/ise/drp_des/drp_demo.ncd

  Note: The implementation run is created along with a synthesis run when the
  project is first created. The import_as_run command cannot be used on that
  implementation run because the synthesis run has not yet been completed.
  However, when the design_mode property is next set to a GateLvl design, the
  synthesis run is removed as unnecessary, and only the implementation run is
  left.

  The following example resets an implemented run to prepare it for use by
  the import_as_run command, and then imports an NCD file, a TWX file, and a
  PCF file from an ISE placed and routed design:

    reset_run impl_1  
    import_as_run -run impl_1 -twx C:/Data/ise/drp_des/drp_demo.twx-pcf \ 
    C:/Data/ise/drp_des/drp_demo.pcf C:/Data/ise/drp_des/drp_demo.ncd

  Note: If the reset_run command was not used on the impl_1 run, the
  following error is returned: ERROR: Run needs to be reset before importing
  into it.
