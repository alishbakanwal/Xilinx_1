Description:

  Reports clock interactions and signals that cross clock domains to identify
  potential problems such a metastability, or data loss, or incoherency,
  where some visibility into the paths that cross clock domains is
  beneficial. This command requires an open synthesized or implemented
  design.

  Note: By default the report is written to the Tcl console or STD output.
  However, the results can also be written to a file or returned as a string
  if desired.

Arguments:

  -delay_type <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the type of delay to analyze when
  running the clock interaction report. The valid values are min, max, and
  min_max. The default setting for -delay_type is max.

  -setup - (Optional) Check for setup violations. This is the same as
  specifying -delay_type max.

  -hold - (Optional) Check for hold violations. This is the same as
  specifying -delay_type min.

  Note: -setup and -hold can be specified together, which is the same as
  specifying -delay_type min_max.

  -significant_digits <arg> - (Optional) The number of significant digits in
  the output results. The valid range is 0 to 3. The default setting is 2
  significant digits.

  -no_header - (Optional) Do not write a header to the report.

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file. The
  specified file will be overwritten if one already exists, unless -append is
  also specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -name <arg> - (Optional) The name of the Clock Interaction Report view to
  display in the tool GUI mode. If the name has already been used in an open
  Report view, that view will be closed and a new report opened.

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string rather than
  to the standard output. The Tcl string can be captured by a variable
  definition and parsed or otherwise processed.

  Note: This argument cannot be used with the -file option.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example sets the model for interconnect delay, selects a
  device speed grade, and then runs report_clock_interaction:

    
    set_delay_model -interconnect none 
    set_speed_grade -3 
    report_clock_interaction -delay_type min_max \ 
       -significant_digits 3 -name "results_1"

  The following example returns the clock interactions, writing the report to
  the GUI, to the specified file, and returns a string which is assigned to
  the specified variable:

    set clk_int [report_clock_interaction -file clk_int.txt -name clk_int1 \ 
    -return_string]
