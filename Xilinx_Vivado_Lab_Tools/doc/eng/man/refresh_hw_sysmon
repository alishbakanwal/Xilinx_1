Description:

  Refresh the properties of the hw_sysmon object with the values on the
  system monitor (XADC) from the current hw_device.

  The refresh command takes the values from the status registers of the
  system monitor on the hardware device, and populates them into the
  appropriate properties of the hw_sysmon object in the hardware manager.

  Note: The hw_sysmon object is automatically refreshed at the rate specified
  by the SYSMON_REFRESH_RATE_MS on the object.

  This command updates the properties on the hw_sysmon object, but otherwise
  returns nothing if successful. The command returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -regexp - (Optional) The list of properties to refresh is defined using
  regular expression.

  -properties <args> - (Optional) Refresh the specified property or
  properties of the hw_sysmon object. As a default behavior, if no properties
  are specified, all properties of the specified object or objects will be
  refreshed from the current values on the hardware device.

  Note: If a non-existent property is specified, that property is ignored.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_objects> - (Optional) Specify the system monitor to refresh the
  properties of, with values from the hw_device. The system monitor object
  can be specified as the hw_sysmon object, or as the system monitor through
  the associated hw_device, hw_target, or hw_server objects.

  Note: The objects must be specified using the appropriate get_hw_xxx
  command, for instance get_hw_sysmon, rather than specified by name.

Example:

  The following example refreshes the TEMPERATURE property of the hardware
  system monitor object with the actual temperature on the current device:

    refresh_hw_sysmon -properties {TEMPERATURE} [lindex [get_hw_sysmons] 0]
