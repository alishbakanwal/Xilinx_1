Description:

  Opens a new or existing netlist design, linking the netlist files and
  constraints with the target part to create the design. This command is
  intended for use with netlist source files, such as files generated by
  third party synthesis tools, or Vivado synthesis through the synth_design
  command.

  The DESIGN_MODE property for the current source fileset must be defined as
  GateLvl in order to open a netlist design. If not, you will get the
  following error:

    ERROR: The design mode of `sources_1` must be GateLvl.

  For project based designs with RTL source files, use launch_runs to launch
  synthesis or implementation, and then use the open_run command to open the
  design.

  For non-project based designs, use the open_checkpoint command to open a
  checkpoint into memory, opening the design in Non-Project Mode. Refer to
  the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Design Flows Overview (UG892) for more
  information on Project Mode and Non-Project Mode.

Arguments:

  -name <arg> - (Optional) This is the name assigned to the netlist design
  when it is opened by the Vivado tool. This name is for reference purposes,
  and has nothing to do with the top-level of the design or any logic
  contained within.

  -part <arg> - (Optional) The Xilinx device to use when creating a new
  design. If the part is not specified the default part will be used.

  -constrset <arg> - (Optional) The name of the constraint fileset to use
  when opening the design.

  Note: The -constrset argument must refer to a constraint fileset that
  exists. It cannot be used to create a new fileset. Use create_fileset for
  that purpose.

  -top <arg> - (Optional) The name of the top module of the design hierarchy
  of the netlist.

  Note: When specifying -top with an EDIF netlist-based design, or design
  checkpoint (DCP) file, the name of the top-level cell must match the
  top-level cell defined in the EDIF or DCP file.

  -mode [ default | out_of_context ] - (Optional) If you have synthesized a
  block, and disabled IO buffer insertion, you can load the resulting EDIF
  into the Vivado Design Suite using -mode out_of_context. This enables
  implementation of the module without IO buffers, prevents optimization due
  to unconnected inputs or outputs, and adjusts DRC rules appropriately for
  the design. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Hierarchical
  Design (UG905) for more information.

  -pr_config <arg> - (Optional) For the Partial Reconfiguration (PR)
  project-based design flow, this option specifies the PR Configuration to
  apply while opening the design. For PR designs, the create_pr_configuration
  command lets you associate a Reconfigurable Module (RM) with each Partition
  Definition in the design. This option tells the Vivado tool to link the
  design checkpoint files for the RMs into the design. See the Vivado Design
  Suite User Guide: Partial Reconfiguration (UG909) for more information.

  -reconfig_partitions <args> - (Optional) Specify a list of reconfigurable
  partitions to load while opening the design. The specified reconfigurable
  partitions are marked with the HD.RECONFIGURABLE property for proper
  handling in the design.

  -partitions <args> - (Optional) List of hierarchical design partitions to
  load while opening the design. Hierarchical design partitions are marked
  with the HD.PARTITION property. See the Vivado Design Suite User Guide:
  Hierarchical Design (UG905) for more information.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following creates a new netlist design called Net1:

    link_design -name Net1

  Note: The default source set, constraint set, and part will be used in this
  example.

  The following example opens a netlist design called Net1, and specifies the
  constraint set to be used:

    link_design -name Net1 -constrset con1
