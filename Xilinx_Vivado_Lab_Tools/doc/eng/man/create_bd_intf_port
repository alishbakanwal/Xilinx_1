Description:

  Create a new IP Integrator subsystem design interface port. An IP
  Integrator interface is a grouping of signals that share a common function,
  and can include both individual signals and buses that share a related
  function. An AXI4-Lite master, for example, is an interface that includes a
  large number of individual signals plus multiple buses.

  To create a single connection port, or common bus port, use the
  create_bd_port command.

  This command returns the name of the newly created interface port object if
  successful, and returns nothing if it failed.

Arguments:

  -vlnv <arg> - (Required) The Vendor:Library:Name:Version (VLNV) attribute
  of the interface port object to be added to the subsystem design. The VLNV
  attribute identifies the object in the IP Integrator catalog.

  Note: The -vlnv property for interface pins and ports refers to files in
  the Vivado Design Suite installation hierarchy that can be found at . -vlnv
  xilinx.com:interface:lmb_rtl:1.0 for example, is located in the Vivado
  Design Suite installation at data/ip/interfaces/lmb_v1_0.

  -mode <arg> - (Required) Defines the mode of the interface pin. Accepted
  values are Master, Slave, System, MirroredMaster, MirroredSlave,
  MirroredSystem, Monitor.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) The name of the interface port to add to the subsystem
  design.

Example:

  The following example creates a new IP Integrator interface port and adds
  it to the current subsystem design:

    create_bd_intf_port -vlnv xilinx.com:interface:diff_clock_rtl:1.0 \ 
       -mode Slave diff_clock_rtl
