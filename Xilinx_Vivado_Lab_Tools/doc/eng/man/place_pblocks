Description:

  Places Pblocks onto the fabric of the FPGA. Pblocks must be created using
  the create_pblock command, and should be populated with assigned logic
  using the add_cells_to_pblock command.

  Note: An empty Pblock will be placed as directed, but results in a Pblock
  covering a single CLB tile (two SLICEs).

Arguments:

  -effort <arg> - (Optional) Effort level that the Pblock placer should use
  in placing each Pblock onto the fabric. Valid values are LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH,
  with the default being HIGH.

  -utilization <arg> - (Optional) The percentage of slice resources on the
  target device that should be consumed by the logic elements assigned to a
  Pblock. For instance, a utilization rate of 50% means that half of the
  slice resources within the Pblock area should be allocated for use by the
  Pblock, and half should be left for use by other logic in the design. A
  high utilization value makes the Pblock smaller and more dense, but can
  make the overall design more difficult to place.

  Note: Pblock utilization considers only slice-based device resources, and
  is estimated based on the post-synthesis logic assigned to a Pblock. Actual
  placement results may vary, and may require you to resize the Pblock using
  the resize_pblock command.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <pblocks> - (Required) One or more Pblocks to be placed onto the fabric of
  the FPGA.

Examples:

  The following example places the specified Pblocks with a utilization of 75%:

    place_pblocks -effort LOW -utilization 75 block1 block2 block3 block4 block5
