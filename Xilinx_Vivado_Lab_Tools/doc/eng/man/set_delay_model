Description:

  Sets the interconnect delay model for timing analysis. There are three
  settings for the interconnect delay model: "actual", "estimated", or
  "none".

   *  If "actual" is selected, the actual delay from the routed interconnect
      will be used in timing analysis. If the design is only partially
      routed, then the actual delay from the routed portion will be used,
      along with estimated delay for the unrouted portion. The timing report
      will provide details regarding the source of the calculated delay.

   *  If "estimated" delays are selected, the timing analysis will include an
      estimate of the interconnect delays based on the placement and
      connectivity of the design onto the device prior to implementation.
      Estimated delay can be specified even if the design is fully routed.

   *  If "none" is selected, then no interconnect delay is included in the
      timing analysis, and only the logic delay is applied.

  Note: This command operates silently and does not return direct feedback of
  its operation.

Arguments:

  -interconnect [ actual | estimated | none ] - (Optional) Delay model to be
  used. The default setting is actual.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following command will use a timing delay model which is an estimated
  value.

    set_delay_model -interconnect estimated
