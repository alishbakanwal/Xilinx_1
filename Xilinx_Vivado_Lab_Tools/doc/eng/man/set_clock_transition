Description:

  Defines transition times in nanoseconds (ns) on register clock pins in the
  fanout of the specified clocks. This command is primarily used to specify
  the slew of the clock. Slew is the amount of time it takes for a signal to
  change from low to high or from high to low.

  This command is applicable only for ideal clocks. Once the design is
  implemented the clock latency can be propagated using the
  set_propagated_clock command, and the ideal clock can be ignored.

  Note: This command operates silently and does not return direct feedback of
  its operation.

Arguments:

  -rise - (Optional) Specify transition times for rising clock edges.

  -fall - (Optional) Specify transition time for falling clock edges.

  -min - (Optional) Specify clock rise and fall minimum transition times.

  -max - (Optional) Specify clock rise and fall maximum transition times.

  Note: The -min and -max options are mutually exclusive.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <transition> - The transition time in nanoseconds of the register pins
  clocked by the specified clocks.

  <clocks> - A list of clocks on which to apply the transition. The
  <transition> is applied to the register pins on the specified clocks.

Examples:

  The following example is applied to all register clock pins in the
  transitive fanout of the specified clock:

    set_clock_transition -rise 0.5 [get_clocks CLK_A]
