Description:

  Promotes previously implemented partitions to make them available for
  import and reuse in other designs.

Arguments:

  -partition_names <arg> - (Optional) The partition or partitions to be
  promoted.

  -promote_dir <arg> - (Optional) The path and directory into which to write
  the partition data.

  Note: If the specified directory already exists, the promote_run command
  will overwrite it without warning.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the directory name, the tool
  will create a directory in your home directory.

   *  For Windows: %APPDATA%/Xilinx/PlanAhead

   *  For Linux: $HOME/.Xilinx/PlanAhead

  -description <{text description}> - (Optional) A description of the
  partition being promoted. Enclose <text> in braces {}. This description can
  be displayed or queried when using the partition in another design.

  -no_state_update - (Optional) Do not automatically update partition states.
  By default the tool will notify you of any updates to a promoted partition.
  After promotion, the partition state will change to import for promoted
  partitions.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <run> - The implemented run to be promoted.

Examples:

  The following example promotes the synthesis run for the usbEngine0 and
  usbEngine1 partitions, and promotes the implementation run for usbEngine0:

    promote_run -run synth_1 -partition_names {usbEngine0 usbEngine1} -promote_dir \ 
    C:/Data/partition/DP_RTL.promote/Xsynth_1 
    promote_run -run impl_1 -partition_names usbEngine0 -promote_dir \ 
    C:/Data/partition/DP_RTL.promote/Ximpl_1 -description {Implementation of USB0}
