Description:

  Reimports project files. This updates the local project files from the
  original referenced source files.

Arguments:

  -force - (Optional) Reimport files even when the local project files may be
  newer than their referenced source files.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <files> - (Optional) List of files to reimport. If no files are specified,
  all files in the project that are out-of-date, will be reimported. If you
  use -force and specify no files, all files in the project will be
  reimported.

Examples:

  The following example reimports all project files regardless of whether
  they are out of date, or the local files are newer than the referenced
  source file:

    reimport_files -force

  Note: No warnings will be issued for newer local files that will be
  overwritten.

  The following example reimports the specified files to the project, but
  only if the original source file is newer than the local project file:

    reimport_files C:/Data/FPGA_Design/source1.v \ 
       C:/Data/FPGA_Design/source2.vhdl
