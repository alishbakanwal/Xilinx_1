Description:

  Analyzes the implemented configurations of a design to ensure they follow
  rules required for partial reconfiguration.

Arguments:

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Output the results of this command to the
  specified log file.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <runs> - The list of two or more implemented configuration runs to verify.
  These specify the runs used to implement the different configurations of
  the design.

Examples:

  The following example checks two runs, config_2 and config_3, for any
  errors and writes the log into the specified log file:

    verify_config -runs {config_2 config_3} -file pr_verify.log
