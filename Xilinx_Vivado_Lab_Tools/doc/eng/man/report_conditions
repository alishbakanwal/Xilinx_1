Description:

  Report a specific simulation condition, or report all conditions in the
  current simulation. You must have an open simulation for this command to
  return anything.

  Conditions can be defined prior to starting the simulation. When a
  condition is added, the simulator evaluates the condition expression
  anytime a signal change is detected. When a specified condition expression
  becomes TRUE, the condition commands are run.

  This command returns the condition identifier, expression, commands, and
  names of conditions, or returns an error if the command fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <ConditionObjs> - (Optional) Specifies one or more condition identifiers in
  the current simulation to report. The condition identifiers are returned by
  the add_condition command when the condition is defined. BY default the
  command reports all conditions.

Examples:

  The following example reports conditions in the current simulation. The
  condition identifier, expression, commands, and names are reported:

    
    report_conditions 
    #2: condition2 
         Expression: {/testbench/reset == 0 } 
         Command:    { 
    puts "Condition Reset was encountered at [current_time]. \ 
       Stopping simulation." 
    stop } 
         Name:       resetLow 
    #3: condition3 
         Expression: {/testbench/leds_n == X000 } 
         Command:    { 
    puts "Condition LED Unknown was encountered at [current_time]. \ 
       Stopping simulation." 
    stop } 
         Name:       ledUnknown 
    <apiname></apiname>
