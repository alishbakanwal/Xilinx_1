Description:

  Because physical optimization requires timing data that is only available
  after placement, the phys_opt_design command cannot be run prior to
  placement. However, the interactive physical optimization feature, or
  iphys_opt_design, lets you write out the physical optimizations performed
  on the post-placed design, and then apply those optimizations to the design
  netlist prior to placement. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide:
  Implementation (UG904) for more information on interactive physical
  optimization.

  Interactive physical optimization can be used in two ways:

   *  Applying post-placement physical optimizations to the pre-placement
      netlist to improve the overall placement result and improve design
      performance.

   *  Saving the physical optimizations in a Tcl script to be repeated as
      needed.

  The write_iphys_opt_tcl command can only be run after placement, on a
  design that has had actual physical optimizations performed.

  Note: You can use the report_phys_opt command to report the physical
  optimizations that have been performed on the design.

  The output is a Tcl script file with a sequence of iphys_opt_design
  commands listing the specific optimizations performed by the
  phys_opt_design command. The iphys_opt Tcl script can be edited to change
  the specific optimizations performed. The Tcl script provides a history of
  the physical optimizations performed on the design after placement, marked
  by date and history.

  This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -place - (Optional) Write out placement data for optimized cells in the
  design, as well as the physical optimization Tcl commands. The default
  iphys_opt Tcl script does not include the placement data.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <output> - (Required) The name of the interactive physical optimization Tcl
  file to write. You should specify the path, name, and extension for the
  file.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example writes the physical optimizations that have been
  performed in the current design to the specified Tcl script:

    write_iphys_opt_tcl C:/Data/myDesign_physopt.tcl
