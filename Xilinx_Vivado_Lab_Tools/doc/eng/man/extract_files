Description:

  Extract the files from an IP in core container format.

  The core container format for IP is a compressed zip file that reduces the
  file structure in the design, and increases tool performance.

  This command returns a list of files extracted from the core container IP,
  or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -base_dir <arg> - (Optional) Specify the directory to write the extracted
  files into. By default the extract_files command will write files into a
  folder called ip_files inside of the current working directory.

  -force - (Optional) Overwrite existing files of the same name if any exist.

  -no_ip_dir - (Optional) Don`t include an IP sub-folder as part of path for
  the the extracted files. In this case, the files will be exported to the
  specified directory, without a sub-folder named after the core container
  IP.

  -no_paths - (Optional) Don`t include sub-folders of the core container in
  the extracted files. This option will cause all files to be extracted to
  the top-level ip_files folder, or the folder specified by the -base_dir
  option.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <files> - (Required) Specify the name of the IP core container (.XCIX) file
  to extract the files from.

Examples:

  The following example extracts the files from the specified core container
  format IP to the specified base directory:

    extract_files -base_dir C:/Data [get_files char_fifo.xcix]
