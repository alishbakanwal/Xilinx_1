Description:

  Get a list of cells in the current IP Integrator subsystem design, or
  current subsystem instance. IP Integrator subsystem cells are either IP
  cores drawn from the IP Integrator catalog, or hierarchical modules created
  in the subsystem design with the create_bd_cell command.

  Note: To improve memory and performance, the get_* commands return a
  container list of a single type of objects (e.g. cells, nets, pins, or
  ports). You can add new objects to the list (using lappend for instance),
  but you can only add the same type of object that is currently in the list.
  Adding a different type of object, or string, to the list is not permitted
  and will result in a Tcl error.

Arguments:

  -regexp - (Optional) Specifies that the search <patterns> are written as
  regular expressions. Both search <patterns> and -filter expressions must be
  written as regular expressions when this argument is used. Xilinx regular
  expression Tcl commands are always anchored to the start of the search
  string. You can add ".*" to the beginning or end of a search string to
  widen the search to include a substring. See
  http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html for help with regular expression
  syntax.

  Note: The Tcl built-in command regexp is not anchored, and works as a
  standard Tcl command. For more information refer to
  http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/regexp.htm.

  -hierarchical - (Optional) Get cells from all levels of the IP Integrator
  subsystem design hierarchy, or current instance. Without this argument, the
  command will only get cells from the top of the design hierarchy. When
  using -hierarchical, the search pattern should not contain a hierarchy
  separator because the search pattern is applied at each level of the
  hierarchy, not to the full hierarchical cell name. For instance, searching
  for U1/* searches each level of the hierarchy for instances with U1/ in the
  name. This may not return the intended results.

  Note: When used with -regexp, the specified search string is matched
  against the full hierarchical name, and the U1/* search pattern will work
  as intended.

  -filter <args> - (Optional) Filter the results list with the specified
  expression. The -filter argument filters the list of objects returned by
  get_bd_cells based on property values on the block design cells. You can
  find the properties on an object with the report_property or list_property
  commands. In the case of the IP Integrator cell object, "VLNV", "TYPE" and
  "LOCATION" are some of the properties that can be used to filter results.

  The filter search pattern should be quoted to avoid having to escape
  special characters that may be found in net, pin, or cell names, or other
  properties. String matching is case-sensitive and is always anchored to the
  start and to the end of the search string. The wildcard "*" character can
  be used at the beginning or at the end of a search string to widen the
  search to include a substring of the property value.

  Note: The filter returns an object if a specified property exists on the
  object, and the specified pattern matches the property value on the object.
  In the case of the "*" wildcard character, this will match a property with
  a defined value of "".

  For string comparison, the specific operators that can be used in filter
  expressions are "equal" (==), "not-equal" (!=), "match" (=~), and
  "not-match" (!~). Numeric comparison operators <, >, <=, and >= can also be
  used. Multiple filter expressions can be joined by AND and OR (&& and ||).
  The following gets input pins that do NOT contain the "RESET" substring
  within their name:

    get_pins * -filter {DIRECTION == IN && NAME !~ "*RESET*"}

  Boolean (bool) type properties can be directly evaluated in filter
  expressions as true or not true:

    -filter {IS_PRIMITIVE && !IS_LOC_FIXED}

  -of_objects <arg> - (Optional) Get the subsystem cells that are connected
  to the specified pin or net objects, as returned by the get_bd_nets and
  get_bd_pins, or get_bd_intf_pins commands.

  Note: The -of_objects option requires objects to be specified using the
  get_* commands, such as get_cells or get_pins, rather than specifying
  objects by name. In addition, -of_objects cannot be used with a search
  <pattern>.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <patterns> - (Optional) Match subsystem cells against the specified
  patterns. The default pattern is the wildcard `*` which gets a list of all
  cells in the current IP subsystem design. More than one pattern can be
  specified to find multiple cells based on different search criteria.

  Note: You must enclose multiple search patterns in braces {} to present the
  list as a single element.

Examples:

  The following example gets a list of cells that include the specified IP
  Integrator subsystem pin, and sorts the list to remove duplicate entries:

    lsort -unique [get_bd_cells -of_objects [get_bd_pins -hierarchical *aclk*]]

  Note: If there are no cells matching the pattern you will get a warning.

  The following example gets a list of all cells in all levels of the
  subsystem design hierarchy, and then filters the list to include only those
  cells whose name includes the specified text, or hierarchy:

    get_bd_cells -hierarchical -filter {NAME=~"/newMod1/*"}
