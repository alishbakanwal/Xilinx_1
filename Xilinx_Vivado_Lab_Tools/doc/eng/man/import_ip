Description:

  Adds an existing XCI or XCO file as an IP source into the current project,
  and copies it into the local project directory structure.

  The import_ip command allows you to read existing IP files directly, and
  copy them into the local project folders. Use the read_ip or add_files
  command to add IP files by reference into the current project.

  Use the create_ip command to create new IP files from the current IP catalog.

Arguments:

  -srcset <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the source file set to import the IP
  files into. If not specified, the default source file set is sources_1.

  -name <arg> - (Optional) The name to assign to the IP object as it is added
  to the current source fileset. This option can only be used when a single
  file is specified in <files>.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <files> - (Optional) The names of the IP files to be imported into the
  current project. Each IP must be in the form of an existing XCI file or XCO
  file. An XCI file is an IP-XACT format file that contains information about
  the IP parameterization. An XCO file is a CORE Generator log file that
  records all the customization parameters used to create the IP core and the
  project options in effect when the core was generated. The XCI or XCO files
  are used to recreate the core in the current project.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the tool will
  search for the specified file in the current working directory and then in
  the directory from which the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example copies the 10gig ethernet core into the current
  project, and assigns it a name of IP_block1:

    import_ip C:/Data/FPGA_Design/10gig_eth.xci -name IP_block1
