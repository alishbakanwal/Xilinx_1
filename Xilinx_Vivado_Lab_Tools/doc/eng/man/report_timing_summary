Description:

  Note: The report_timing_summary can be multi-threaded to speed the process.
  Refer to the set_param command for more information on setting the
  general.maxThreads parameter.

  Generate a timing summary to help understand if the design has met timing
  requirements. The timing summary can be run on an open Synthesized or
  Implemented Design.

  The timing summary report includes the following information:

   *  Timer Settings - Details the timing engine settings used to generate
      the timing information in the report.

   *  Check Timing - Contains the same information that is produced by the
      check_timing command, which summarizes potential timing issues.

   *  Design Timing Summary - Provides a summary of the timing of the design,
      including values for worst and total negative slack (WNS/TNS), worst
      and total hold slack (WHS/THS), and component switching limits (CSL).

   *  Clock Definitions - Contains the same information that is produced by
      the report_clocks command, showing all the clocks that were created for
      the design, either by create_clock, create_generated_clock, or
      automatically by the tool.

   *  Intra-Clock Table - Summarizes timing paths with the same source and
      destination clocks.

   *  Inter-Clock Table - Summarizes timing paths with different source and
      destination clocks.

   *  Path Group Table - Shows default path groups and user-defined path
      groups created by the group_path command.

   *  Timing Details - Contains detailed timing paths, both max delay and min
      delay, as well as component switching limits for each clock defined,
      similar to the report_timing command.

   *  Data sheet - Contains the same information that is produced by the
      report_datasheet command. It contains the timing characteristics of a
      design at the I/O ports. The data sheet information is added to the
      summary report only when the -datasheet option is specified.

  This command is automatically run during implementation as part of the
  launch_runs command.

  Note: By default the report is written to the Tcl console or STD output.
  However, the results can also be written to a file or returned as a string
  if desired.

Arguments:

  -check_timing_verbose - (Optional) Output a verbose timing summary report.

  -delay_type <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the type of delay to analyze when
  running the timing report. The valid values are min, max, min_max. The
  default setting for -delay_type is min_max.

  -no_detailed_paths - (Optional) Do not report the full timing path for each
  clock or path group analyzed.

  -setup - (Optional) Check for setup violations. This is the same as
  specifying -delay_type max.

  -hold - (Optional) Check for hold violations. This is the same as
  specifying -delay_type min.

  Note: -setup and -hold can be specified together, which is the same as
  specifying -delay_type min_max.

  -max_paths <arg> - (Optional) The maximum number of paths to report per
  clock or per path group. This is specified as a value greater than or equal
  to 1. By default the report_timing_summary command will report the single
  worst timing path, or the worst path per path group.

  -nworst <arg> - (Optional) The number of timing paths to output in the
  timing report. The timing report will return the <N> worst paths to
  endpoints based on the specified value, greater than or equal to 1. The
  default setting is 1.

  -unique_pins - (Optional) Only report timing paths through each unique set
  of pins, reporting one path per path group.

  -path_type <arg> - (Optional) Specify the path data to output in the timing
  summary report. The default format is full_clock_expanded. The valid path
  types are:

   *  end - Shows the endpoint of the path only, with calculated timing values.

   *  summary - Displays the startpoints and endpoints with slack calculation.

   *  short - Displays the startpoints and endpoints with calculated timing
      values.

   *  full - Displays the full timing path, including startpoints, through
      points, and endpoints.

   *  full_clock - Displays full clock paths in addition to the full timing
      path.

   *  full_clock_expanded - Displays full clock paths between a master clock
      and generated clocks in addition to the full_clock timing path. This is
      the default setting.

  -label_reused - (Optional) For designs using incremental place and route
  (read_checkpoint -incremental), label pins with information related to the
  physical data reused from the specified incremental checkpoint. Reuse
  labels include:

   *  R : Cell placement and routing to this pin are reused.

   *  PNR : Cell placement is reused but routing to this pin is not reused.

   *  NR : Neither cell placement nor routing to this pin is reused.

   *  N : The cell, net, or pin is new. It does not exist in the incremental
      checkpoint.

  -input_pins - (Optional) Show input pins in the timing path report. For use
  with -path_type full, full_clock, and full_clock_expanded.

  -slack_lesser_than <arg> - (Optional) Report timing on paths with a
  calculated slack value less than the specified value.

  -report_unconstrained - (Optional) Report timing on unconstrained paths in
  the current design. As a default, the report_timing_summary command will
  not include unconstrained timing paths.

  -significant_digits <arg> - (Optional) The number of significant digits in
  the output results. The valid range is 0 to 3. The default setting is 3
  significant digits.

  -no_header - (Optional) Do not add header information to the report. This
  can be useful when returning the timing summary report to a string for
  further processing.

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file. The
  specified file will be overwritten if one already exists, unless -append is
  also specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -name <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the name of the results set for the GUI.
  Timing summary reports in the GUI can be deleted by the
  delete_timing_results command.

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string rather than
  to the standard output. The Tcl string can be captured by a variable
  definition and parsed or otherwise processed.

  Note: This argument cannot be used with the -file option.

  -warn_on_violation - (Optional) Specify that a Critical Warning will be
  generated by the Vivado Design Suite when the timing report contains a
  timing violation.

  -datasheet - (Optional) Generate data sheet information to add to the
  summary report.

  -cell <arg> - (Optional) Run the timing summary report from the level of
  the specified cell instance. A cell can be specified by name, or as an
  object returned by the get_cells command.

  -rpx <arg> - (Optional) Specify the file name and path of an Xilinx report
  file (RPX) to write. This is different from writing the report results to a
  file using the -file argument. The RPX file is an interactive report that
  contains all the report information and can be reloaded into memory in the
  Vivado Design Suite using the open_report command. You should add a .rpx
  file extension to the specified file name, as the Vivado tool will not
  automatically assign a file extension.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example reports the timing summary of the current design:

    report_timing_summary

  design, including unconstrained paths, with the specified options:

    report_timing_summary -delay_type min -path_type full_clock_expanded \ 
       -report_unconstrained -max_paths 2 -nworst 1 -significant_digits 2 \
