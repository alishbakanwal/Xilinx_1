Description:

  Describe an HDL object (variable, signal, wire, or reg) by printing type
  and declaration information, as well as path, and file information for the
  HDL source of the specified objects.

  Note: The describe command works for a single HDL object. Use the
  report_objects command for a brief report on multiple HDL objects.

  HDL objects include HDL signals, variables, or constants as defined in the
  Verilog or VHDL testbench and source files. An HDL signal includes Verilog
  wire or reg entities, and VHDL signals. Examples of HDL variables include
  Verilog real, realtime, time, and event. HDL constants include Verilog
  parameters and localparams, and VHDL generic and constants.

  The command returns the description of specified HDL objects, or returns an
  error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hdl_object> - (Required) Specifies a single HDL object to describe.

  Note: Objects can be specified by name, or returned as objects by the
  get_objects command.

Examples:

  The following example shows how the objects description depends on the
  scope of the current simulation:

    current_scope testbench 
    /testbench 
    describe leds_n 
        Signal: {leds_n[3:0]} 
        Path: {/testbench/leds_n} 
        Location: {File "C:/Data/ug937/sim/testbench.v" Line 9} 
    current_scope dut 
    /testbench/dut 
    describe leds_n 
        Port(OUT): {LEDS_n[3:0]} 
        Path: {/testbench/dut/LEDS_n} 
        Location: {File "C:/Data/sources/sinegen_demo.vhd" Line 42}
