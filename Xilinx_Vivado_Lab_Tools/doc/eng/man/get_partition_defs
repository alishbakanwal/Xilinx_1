Description:

  Note: You must first define the project as a Partial Reconfiguration (PR)
  project by setting the PR_FLOW property on the project to TRUE, or by using
  the <uicontrol>Tools > Enable Partial Reconfiguration</uicontrol> command.

  Get a list of all Partition Definition (partitionDef) objects in the
  current design, or the partitionDefs that match a specified search pattern.

  The Partial Reconfiguration flow lets you create Partition Definitions
  (partitionDefs) from hierarchical cells in a design, and to specify
  reconfigurable modules (RMs) to be assigned to these partitionDefs to
  create a unique configurations of the design based on the combination of
  the core design and one or more RMs. The PR design flow requires the
  implementation of each PR configuration, resulting in partial bitstreams
  for the RMs, but complete bitstreams for each integrated configuration.
  Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Partial Reconfiguration
  (UG909) for more information.

  This command returns a list of partitionDef objects, or returns an error if
  the command fails.

Arguments:

  -regexp - (Optional) Specifies that the search <patterns> are written as
  regular expressions. Both search <patterns> and -filter expressions must be
  written as regular expressions when this argument is used. Xilinx regular
  expression Tcl commands are always anchored to the start of the search
  string. You can add ".*" to the beginning or end of a search string to
  widen the search to include a substring. See
  http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html for help with regular expression
  syntax.

  Note: The Tcl built-in command regexp is not anchored, and works as a
  standard Tcl command. For more information refer to
  http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/regexp.htm.

  -nocase - (Optional) Perform case-insensitive matching when a pattern has
  been specified. This argument applies to the use of -regexp only.

  -filter <args> - (Optional) Filter the results list with the specified
  expression. The -filter argument filters the list of objects returned by
  get_partition_defs based on property values on the partitionDefs. You can
  find the properties on an object with the report_property or list_property
  commands. In the case of the "partitionDef" object, "DEFAULT_RM" and
  "LIBRARY" are two of the properties that can be used to filter results.

  The filter search pattern should be quoted to avoid having to escape
  special characters that may be found in net, pin, or cell names, or other
  properties. String matching is case-sensitive and is always anchored to the
  start and to the end of the search string. The wildcard "*" character can
  be used at the beginning or at the end of a search string to widen the
  search to include a substring of the property value.

  Note: The filter returns an object if a specified property exists on the
  object, and the specified pattern matches the property value on the object.
  In the case of the "*" wildcard character, this will match a property with
  a defined value of "".

  For string comparison, the specific operators that can be used in filter
  expressions are "equal" (==), "not-equal" (!=), "match" (=~), and
  "not-match" (!~). Numeric comparison operators <, >, <=, and >= can also be
  used. Multiple filter expressions can be joined by AND and OR (&& and ||).
  The following gets input pins that do NOT contain the "RESET" substring
  within their name:

    get_pins * -filter {DIRECTION == IN && NAME !~ "*RESET*"}

  Boolean (bool) type properties can be directly evaluated in filter
  expressions as true or not true:

    -filter {IS_PRIMITIVE && !IS_LOC_FIXED}

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <patterns> - (Optional) Match partitionDefs against the specified search
  pattern. The default pattern is the wildcard `*` which gets a list of all
  partitionDefs in the project.

Example:

  The following example gets all of the partitionDef objects in the project:

    get_partition_defs
