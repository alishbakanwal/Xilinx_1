Description:

  Report formatted information on memory IP hardware configuration,
  calibration, and margin. Does not include the graphical margin scan plots
  that are available within the Vivado logic analyzer, or Vivado Lab Edition.

  In the Vivado tools, memory controllers implemented into a design are
  associated with hw_mig objects. These hw_mig objects let you verify the
  calibration, read, and write window margins in your memory interface
  design. You can use the hardware manager GUI to check the calibration
  status, verify the read margin for both rising and falling edges of the
  clock, and write margin for both simple and complex patterns, or DQS. You
  can also use an ILA core to verify the data integrity for the read and
  write operations.

  This command returns the reported data, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string rather than
  to the standard output. The Tcl string can be captured by a variable
  definition and parsed or otherwise processed.

  Note: This argument cannot be used with the -file option.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_objects> - (Optional) Inputs can be any hw_mig, hw_device, hw_target,
  or hw_server object.

  Note: The objects must be specified using the appropriate get_hw_xxx
  command, for instance get_hw_migs, rather than specified by name.

Examples:

  The following example generates the report on the hw_mig objects and
  outputs to the text file specified:

    report_hw_mig -file C:/Data/hw_mig_report.txt [get_hw_migs]
