Description:

  Perform a simultaneous switching noise (SSN) analysis of the current
  design. The SSN analysis is an accurate method for predicting how output
  switching affects interface noise margins. The calculation and estimates
  are based on a range of variables intended to identify potential
  noise-related issues in your design and should not be used as final design
  "sign off" criteria.

  SSN analysis provides estimates of the disruption that simultaneously
  switching outputs can cause on other output ports in the I/O bank. The SSN
  predictor incorporates I/O bank-specific electrical characteristics into
  the prediction to better model package effects on SSN.

  The report_ssn command can be affected by the temperature grade of the
  selected device as defined by the -grade option of the
  set_operating_condition command. Setting the temperature grade prior to
  running noise analysis lets you see how noisy signals can be on Commercial,
  Extended, Industrial, Q-Grade, or Military grade devices.

  By default, report_ssn assumes that every port toggles asynchronously. This
  results in a worst-case noise analysis, which may be overly pessimistic.
  The -phase option lets you consider clocking information available in the
  design to more accurately report SSN noise. Clocks must be defined using
  the create_clock and create_generated_clock commands. The period, phase
  shift and duty cycle of the generated clocks have significant impact on SSN
  analysis.

  The report_ssn command provides a detailed SSN analysis for Xilinx
  UltraScale architecture devices, Virtex-7, Kintex-7, and Artix-7 devices.
  The report is returned to the standard output, unless the -file,
  -return_string, or -name arguments are specified.

  Note: Not all parts support the report_ssn command. The Vivado Design Suite
  will return an error if you run report_ssn on a target part that does not
  support SSN analysis. You can query the SSN_REPORT property of a part to
  see if it supports the command. Refer to the Examples for more information.

Arguments:

  -name <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the name of the results to output to the
  GUI.

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string. The Tcl
  string can be captured by a variable definition and parsed or otherwise
  processed.

  Note: This argument cannot be used with the -file option.

  -format [ CSV | HTML | TXT ] - (Optional) Specifies the format of the
  output as either comma-separated values (CSV), HTML, or an ASCII (TXT)
  file. The default output is CSV.

  Note: The format applies when -file is specified, but is otherwise ignored.

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the SSN report into the specified file. The
  specified file will be overwritten if one already exists, unless -append is
  also specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - Append the output of the command to the specified file rather
  than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -phase - (Optional) Consider clock switching cycles in SSN analysis to
  provide a more accurate result.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example performs an SSN analysis on the current design,
  formats the output as HTML, and writes the output to the specified file:

    report_ssn -format html -file C:/Data/devSSN.html

  The following example performs an SSN analysis, with phase analysis, and
  returns the output to a string which is stored in the specified variable:

    set devSSN [report_ssn -phase -format html -return_string]

  Note: The -format argument in the preceding example is ignored in the
  absence of -file.

  The following example queries the part in the current project to see if it
  supports the report_ssn command, and then gets a list of parts from the
  same part family that support the command:

    get_property SSN_REPORT [get_property PART [current_project]] 
    get_parts -filter "FAMILY == [get_property FAMILY [get_property PART \ 
    [current_project]]] && SSN_REPORT"
