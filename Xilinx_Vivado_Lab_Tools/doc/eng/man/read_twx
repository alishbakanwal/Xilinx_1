Description:

  Imports timing results in the TWX format timing report files generated by
  the Xilinx Timing Reporter And Circuit Evaluator (TRACE) tool. The TWX file
  can be imported at the top-level, which is the default, or at a specific
  cell-level or relative to a specific Pblock.

  After the TWX files are imported, the timing results display in the Timing
  Results view in GUI mode.

Arguments:

  -cell <arg> - (Optional) Specify The name of a hierarchical cell in the
  current design to import the TWX file into. The timing paths will be
  applied to the specified cell.

  -pblock <arg> - (Optional) The name of a Pblock in the current design. The
  timing paths will be imported relative to the specified block.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) The name of the Timing Results view to create when
  importing the timing paths in the TWX file.

  Note: Both <name> and <file> are required positional arguments. The <name>
  argument must be provided first.

  <file> - (Required) The file name of the TWX file to be imported.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the tool will
  search for the specified file in the current working directory and then in
  the directory from which the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example reads the specified TWX file into the top-level of
  the design:

    read_twx C:/Data/timing_files/bft.twx
