Description:

  Set the current instance in the design hierarchy to the specified instance
  cell or to the top of the current design. By default, current_instance
  points to the top module of the current_design, which is not an
  instantiated cell object. You can also set current_instance to reference an
  instantiated hierarchical cell in the design.

  Note: Since the top module is not an instantiated object, current_instance
  returns an empty string rather than a design object, when set to the
  top-level of the current design.

  The current design and current instance are the target of most of the
  commands and design changes you will make. The current design can be
  defined using the current_design command.

  You must specify the <instance> name relative to the currently defined
  instance, and use the established hierarchy separator to define instance
  paths. You can determine the current hierarchy separator with the
  get_hierarchy_separator command.

  Use `..` to traverse up the hierarchical instance path when specifying the
  current instance.

  This command returns the name of the design object of the current_instance,
  or returns nothing when set to the top of current design.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <instance> - (Optional) The name of the instance to be set as the current
  instance of the current design.

   *  The <instance> is specified relative to the presently defined current
      instance, using the defined hierarchy separator.

   *  Use `..` to move up one level of the hierarchy relative to the current
      instance.

   *  If the <instance> argument is omitted, the current instance is reset to
      the top module in the design hierarchy.

   *  If the <instance> is specified as `.` then the name of the current
      instance is returned, and the instance is not changed.

Examples:

  The following example sets the current instance to the top module of the
  current design:

    current_instance 
       INFO: [Vivado 12-618] Current instance is the top level of design `netlist_1`.

  In this example you have selected an object in the Vivado IDE, and you want
  to set that selected object as the current instance:

    current_instance [lindex [get_selected_objects] 0]

  Note: get_selected_objects returns a list, even of one object, so you must
  use lindex to specify an object from that list.

  The following example first sets the hierarchy separator character, and
  then sets the current instance relative to the presently defined current
  instance:

    set_hierarchy_separator | 
    current_instance ..|cpu_iwb_dat_o|buffer_fifo

  The following example returns the name of the presently defined current
  instance:

    current_instance . 
    cpuEngine|cpu_iwb_dat_o|buffer_fifo
