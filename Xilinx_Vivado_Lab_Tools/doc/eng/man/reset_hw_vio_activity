Description:

  Resets the ACTIVITY_VALUE properties for all hardware probes on the
  specified VIO debug core objects. The ACTIVITY_VALUE property is used by
  the Vivado IDE to represent transitions on the input probes of the VIO
  debug cores.

  In addition to reading values from the VIO input probes, you can also
  monitor the activity of the VIO input probes. The ACTIVITY_VALUE property
  is used to indicate when the values on the VIO inputs have changed in
  between periodic updates to the Vivado IDE. Refer to the Vivado Design
  Suite User Guide: Programming and Debugging (UG908) for more information.

  This command returns nothing if successful, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_vios> - (Required) Specify one or more hw_vio objects to reset. The
  hw_vio objects can either be specified as objects returned by the
  get_hw_vios command, or specified by name.

Example:

  The following example resets the input activity properties of the VIO debug
  core:

    reset_hw_vio_activity [get_hw_vios]
