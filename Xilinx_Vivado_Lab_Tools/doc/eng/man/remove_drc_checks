Description:

  Remove the specified design rule checks from a drc_ruledeck object.

  A rule deck is a collection of design rule checks grouped for convenience,
  to be run with the report_drc command at different stages of the FPGA
  design flow, such as during I/O planning or placement. The tool comes with
  a set of factory defined rule decks, but you can also create new
  user-defined rule decks with the create_drc_ruledeck command.

  Checks are added to a rule deck using the add_drc_checks command.

  The DRC rule check object features the IS_ENABLED property that can be set
  to true or false using the set_property command. When a new rule check is
  created, the IS_ENABLED property is set to true as a default. Set the
  IS_ENABLED property to false to disable the rule check from being used by
  report_drc without having to remove the rule from the rule deck.

  Note: Use the reset_drc_check command to restore the DRC rule, and its
  properties, to the default settings.

  This command returns the list of design rule checks that were removed from
  the specified rule deck.

Arguments:

  -of_objects <arg> - (Optional) Remove the rule checks of the specified
  drc_ruledeck object from the specified rule deck. This has the effect of
  removing all the rules in one rule deck from the target rule deck.

  Note: The -of_objects option requires objects to be specified using the
  get_* commands, such as get_cells or get_pins, rather than specifying
  objects by name. In addition, -of_objects cannot be used with a search
  <pattern>.

  -regexp - (Optional) Specifies that the search <patterns> are written as
  regular expressions. Both search <patterns> and -filter expressions must be
  written as regular expressions when this argument is used. Xilinx regular
  expression Tcl commands are always anchored to the start of the search
  string. You can add ".*" to the beginning or end of a search string to
  widen the search to include a substring. See
  http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html for help with regular expression
  syntax.

  Note: The Tcl built-in command regexp is not anchored, and works as a
  standard Tcl command. For more information refer to
  http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/regexp.htm.

  -nocase - (Optional) Perform case-insensitive matching when a pattern has
  been specified. This argument applies to the use of -regexp only.

  -filter <args> - (Optional) Filter the results list with the specified
  expression. The -filter argument filters the list of objects returned by
  the search pattern, based on specified property values. You can find the
  properties on an object with the report_property or list_property commands.

  The filter search pattern should be quoted to avoid having to escape
  special characters that may be found in net, pin, or cell names, or other
  properties. String matching is case-sensitive and is always anchored to the
  start and to the end of the search string. The wildcard "*" character can
  be used at the beginning or at the end of a search string to widen the
  search to include a substring of the property value.

  Note: The filter returns an object if a specified property exists on the
  object, and the specified pattern matches the property value on the object.
  In the case of the "*" wildcard character, this will match a property with
  a defined value of "".

  For string comparison, the specific operators that can be used in filter
  expressions are "equal" (==), "not-equal" (!=), "match" (=~), and
  "not-match" (!~). Numeric comparison operators <, >, <=, and >= can also be
  used. Multiple filter expressions can be joined by AND and OR (&& and ||).
  The following gets input pins that do NOT contain the "RESET" substring
  within their name:

    get_pins * -filter {DIRECTION == IN && NAME !~ "*RESET*"}

  Boolean (bool) type properties can be directly evaluated in filter
  expressions as true or not true:

    -filter {IS_PRIMITIVE && !IS_LOC_FIXED}

  -ruledeck <arg> - (Required) The name of the rule deck to remove the
  specified design rule checks from.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <patterns> - (Optional) Remove the design rule checks that match the
  specified patterns from the rule deck. The default pattern is the wildcard
  `*` which removes all rule checks from the specified rule deck. More than
  one pattern can be specified to remove multiple rule checks based on
  different search criteria.

  Note: You must enclose multiple search patterns in braces, {}, or quotes,
  "", to present the list as a single element.

Examples:

  The following example removes the rule checks matching the specified filter
  pattern from the my_rules rule deck:

    remove_drc_checks -filter {GROUP == AVAL} -ruledeck my_rules

  The following example disables the specified DRC check without removing it
  from the rule deck:

    set_property IS_ENABLED FALSE [get_drc_checks RAMW-1]

  The following example removes all rule checks from the specified rule deck:

    remove_drc_checks -ruledeck my_rules
