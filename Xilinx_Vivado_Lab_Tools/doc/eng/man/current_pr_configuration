Description:

  Get or set the current PR configuration.

  In the Partial Reconfiguration (PR) design flow, the PR configuration lets
  you specify a reconfigurable module (RM) to assign to a specific instance
  of a Partition Definition (partitionDef). This flow lets you create unique
  configurations of the design based on the combination of the core design
  and one or more RMs. The PR design flow requires the implementation of each
  PR configuration, resulting in partial bitstreams for the RMs, but complete
  bitstreams for each integrated configuration. Refer to the Vivado Design
  Suite User Guide: Partial Reconfiguration (UG909) for more information.

  The current_pr_configuration either returns the PR configuration that is
  the current or active configfuration in the design, or lets you specify a
  PR configuration to make active.

  This command returns the name of the current PR configuration, or returns
  an error if the command fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <config> - (Optional) Specify a PR configuration to make current. The
  configuration can be specified by name or returned as an object by
  get_pr_configurations. If the configuration is not specified, the current
  PR configuration is returned.

Example:

  The following example sets the current PR configuration as specified:
