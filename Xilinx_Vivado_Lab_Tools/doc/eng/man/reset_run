Description:

  Resets the specified run to an unimplemented or unsynthesized state. Use
  this command to reset the run to prepare it to be run again.

Arguments:

  -prev_step - (Optional) Reset an implementation run from the last step
  completed. This can be used to reset an implementation run that is only
  partially completed because it was launched with the launch_runs -to_step
  command.

  -from_step <arg> - (Optional) Reset an implementation run from a specified
  step. This lets you restart a run from the specified step using the
  launch_runs -next_step command. Valid step values include:

   *  opt_design - Optionally optimize the logical design to more efficiently
      use the target device resources.

   *  power_opt_design - Optionally optimize elements of the logic design to
      reduce power demands of the implemented FPGA.

   *  place_design - Place logic cells onto the target device. This is a
      required step.

   *  power_opt_design (Post-Place) - Optionally optimize power demands of
      the placed logic elements.

   *  phys_opt_design - Optionally optimize design timing by replicating
      drives of high-fanout nets to better distribute the loads.

   *  route_design - Route the connections of the design onto the target
      FPGA. This is a required step.

   *  write_bitstream - Generate a bitstream file for Xilinx device
      configuration. This is a required step.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <run> - (Required) The name of the run to reset.

Examples:

  The following example resets the implementation run:

    reset_run impl_1

  Note: The run directory and its contents will be removed from the hard disk
  since -noclean_dir is not specified.

  The following example resets the synthesis run, but disables the cleanup of
  the run directory:

    reset_run -noclean_dir synth_1

  In this example, because -noclean_dir is specified, the synth_1 run
  directory is not removed and a new run directory called synth_1_2 will be
  created when the run is launched.
