Description:

  Set or get the current wave configuration object for the current simulation.

  In the Vivado<tm tmtype="reg"/> simulator GUI, you can work with a waveform
  to analyze your design and debug your code. A wave configuration displays
  with top-level HDL objects, and can be further populated using commands
  like add_wave and add_wave_divider.

  This command returns the name of the current wave configuration object.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <wcfgObj> - (Optional) Specify a wave configuration object to set as the
  current wave configuration. The wave configuration object can either be
  specified by name, or as an object returned by the get_wave_configs
  command.

Examples:

  The following example gets the testbench wave config object and makes it
  the current wave configuration in the simulation:

    current_wave_config [get_wave_config testbench]
