Description:

  Displays a report of timing paths that will be excluded from timing
  analysis in the current synthesized or implemented design.

  The format of the report is organized into columns for "Cell or Port" to
  define the object associated with the timing path, "From" and "To" to
  define the timing path, the condition, and the reason for excluding the
  path from timing. The various reasons for exclusion are as follows:

   *  constraint - set_disable_timing constraint is specified

   *  constant - Logic constant

   *  loop - Breaks a logic loop

   *  bidirect instance path - Feedback path through bidirectional instances

   *  bidirect net path - Feedback path on nets with bidirectional pins

  Note: By default the report is written to the Tcl console or STD output.
  However, the results can also be written to a file or returned as a string
  if desired.

Arguments:

  -user_disabled - (Optional) Report only the timing arcs that have been
  disabled by the user with the set_disable_timing command.

  -file <arg> - (Optional) Write the report into the specified file. The
  specified file will be overwritten if one already exists, unless -append is
  also specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

  -append - (Optional) Append the output of the command to the specified file
  rather than overwriting it.

  Note: The -append option can only be used with the -file option.

  -return_string - (Optional) Directs the output to a Tcl string rather than
  to the standard output. The Tcl string can be captured by a variable
  definition and parsed or otherwise processed.

  Note: This argument cannot be used with the -file option.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example reports all timing paths that will not be included in
  timing analysis:

    report_disable_timing

  The following example outputs the disable timing report as a string, stores
  it in a variable, and then puts it to the display:

    set bad_time [report_disable_timing -return_string] 
    puts $bad_time
