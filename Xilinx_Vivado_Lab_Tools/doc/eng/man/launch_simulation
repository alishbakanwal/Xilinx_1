Description:

  Launch a simulator to perform analysis and verification of a design.

  The launch_simulation command creates a script file for the target
  simulator and then executes this file in the simulation run directory. The
  simulation results are saved in the log files created in the run directory.

  To run simulation for a specific simulator, you must first define the
  target simulator by setting the TARGET_SIMULATOR property on the design
  project:

    set_property TARGET_SIMULATOR <name> [current_project]

  The TARGET_SIMULATOR property can have a value of XSim, ModelSim, IES, or
  VCS. The default value is XSIM, the Vivado simulator.

  The target simulator can also be defined from the Vivado IDE. Create or
  open a project, select Tools > Project Settings > Simulation menu item, and
  select the Target simulator from the drop-down menu. The available choices
  are: Vivado simulator, ModelSim Simulator, Questa Advanced Simulator,
  Incisive Enterprise Simulator (IES), and Verilog Compiler Simulator (VCS).

  The launch_simulation command uses a three-step process comprised of
  compile, elaborate, and simulate steps. A script file for the target
  simulator is created for each step in the process, (compile.bat,
  elaborate.bat, simulate.bat), and written to the simulation run directory.

  Note: On Linux the script files are named with the .sh suffix instead of
  .bat.

  By default, launch_simulation will run these script files in sequence to
  run the simulation. You can create the scripts without running them by
  using the -scripts_only option.

  This command returns a transcript of its process, or returns an error if it
  fails.

Arguments:

  -simset <arg> - (Optional) The name of the simulation fileset containing
  the simulation test benches and sources to be used during simulation. If
  not specified, the current simulation fileset is used.

  -mode [ behavioral | post-synthesis | post-implementation ] - (Optional)
  Specifies either a behavioral simulation of the HDL design sources to
  verify syntax and confirm that the design performs as intended, a
  functional or timing simulation of the post-synthesis netlist, or a
  functional or timing simulation of the post implementation design to verify
  circuit operation after place and route. The default mode is behavioral.

  -type [ functional | timing ] - (Optional) Specifies functional simulation
  of just the netlist, or timing simulation of the netlist and SDF file. This
  option must be specified with -mode for post-synthesis or
  post-implementation, but cannot be used with -mode behavioral.
  Post-synthesis timing simulation uses SDF component delays from the
  synth_design command. Post-implementation timing simulation uses SDF delays
  from the place_design and route_design commands.

  Note: Do not use -type with -mode behavioral, or the tool will return an
  error.

  -scripts_only - (Optional) Only generate the simulation scripts for the
  target simulator, rather than actually launching these scripts to start the
  "compile", "elaborate" and "simulate" steps. You can use the scripts to
  launch the simulation flow at a later time.

  -of_objects <arg> - (Optional) Run simulation for a single specified
  sub-design, or composite file. The sub-design must be specified as a design
  object as returned by the get_files command, rather than simply specified
  by name.

  -absolute_path - (Optional) Specify this option to define the source and
  include paths used in the simulation scripts as absolute paths. By default,
  all paths are written as relative to the simulation run directory. Relative
  paths include an "origin_dir" variable that is set in the simulation script
  to the current run directory, but you can edit the $origin_dir variable to
  point to a path of your choice when relocating the design and simulation
  scripts.

  -install_path <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the directory containing
  simulator executables ( e.g. vlog.exe, ncvlog, vlogan). If this option is
  not specified, the target simulator will be looked for in the current
  <$PATH>.

  -noclean_dir - (Optional) Do not remove files from the simulation run
  directory prior to launching the simulator. The default behavior is to
  remove files from the simulation run directory to create a clean start.
  With the -noclean_dir option, existing files in the run directory are left
  in place. However, some of the files generated for use by the simulator
  will be overwritten or updated by re-launching the simulator.

  -step - (Optional) Specifies the simulation step to be launched. The valid
  steps are: Compile, Elaborate, Simulate.

  Note: By default, all the steps will be executed.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following commands run behavioral simulation of the design using the
  Vivado simulator:

    set_property target_simulator "XSim" [current_project] 
    launch_simulation

  The following commands run post-synthesis functional simulation of the
  design using the ModelSim Simulator:

    set_property target_simulator "ModelSim" [current_project] 
    launch_simulation -mode "post-synthesis" -type "functional"

  The following commands run post-implementation functional simulation of the
  design using the Cadence IES Simulator:

    set_property target_simulator "IES" [current_project] 
    launch_simulation -mode "post-implementation" -type "functional"

  The following commands run post-implementation timing simulation of the
  design using the Synopsys VCS Simulator:

    set_property target_simulator "VCS" [current_project] 
    launch_simulation -mode "post-implementation" -type "timing"

  The following command generates behavioral simulation scripts for the
  target simulator in the simulation run directory:

    launch_simulation -scripts_only

  The following commands run behavioral simulation flow of the design for the
  "my_simset" simulation fileset for the target simulator in the simulation
  run directory:

    launch_simulation -simset [get_filesets my_simset]

  The following command runs behavioral simulation flow for the
  "char_fifo.xci" IP for the target simulator in the simulation run
  directory, and does not clean up prior simulation files:

    launch_simulation -noclean_dir -of_objects [get_files char_fifo.xci]

  The following command generates absolute paths for the source files in the
  generated script files:

    launch_simulation -absolute_path

  The following command will pick the simulator tools from the specified
  installation path instead of from the PATH variable:

    launch_simulation -install_path /tools/ius/13.20.005/tools/bin
