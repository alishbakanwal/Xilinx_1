Description:

  Launch iMPACT to configure your device and generate programming files. You
  can also read back and verify design configuration data, debug
  configuration problems, or execute XSVF files.

  You must generate the bitstream file using write_bitstream prior to using
  iMPACT.

  The command returns the list of files read.

Arguments:

  -run - (Optional) Launch iMPACT with the specified run. If no run is
  specified, then iMPACT is launched with the active implementation run.

  -ipf - (Optional) Specify the iMPACT project file to use to save the
  results to. The iMPACT Project File (IPF) contains information from a
  previous session of iMPACT. The target device is configured according to
  the settings in the specified IPF file. If you do not specify -ipf, the
  target device is configured according to the default settings.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example launches iMPACT using the specified implementation run:

    launch_impact -run impl_3
