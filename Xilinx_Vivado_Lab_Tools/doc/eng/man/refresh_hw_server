  Refresh or reopen the connection to the current or specified hardware server.

  This command returns the connection messages from the hardware server, or
  returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <hw_server> - (Optional) The hw_server to refresh. If the server is not
  specified, the current_hw_server will be refreshed. The hardware server can
  be specified by name, or specified as a hw_server object returned by the
  get_hw_servers or current_hw_server commands.

Example:

  The following example refreshes the current_hw_server:

    refresh_hw_server

  The following example refreshes all connected hardware servers, printing
  the host name prior to refreshing th server:

    foreach x [get_hw_server] {puts "Refreshing Host $x"; refresh_hw_server $x}
