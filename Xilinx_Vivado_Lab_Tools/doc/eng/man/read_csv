Description:

  Imports port definition and package pin placement information from a comma
  separated value (CSV) file.

  The port definitions in a CSV file can be imported into an I/O Pin Planning
  project. In a Pin Planning project, importing a CSV file replaces the
  current port definitions. Any ports in the design that are not found in the
  imported CSV file will be removed.

  In all other projects the port definitions are defined in the source design
  data, however package pin assignments and port attributes can be read from
  the specified CSV file.

  The ports read from the CSV file can not have spaces in the name, or the
  tool will return an error. The specific format and requirements of the CSV
  file are described in the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: I/O and Clock
  Planning (UG899).

Arguments:

  -quiet_diff_pairs - (Optional) The tool transcripts messages related to
  pins that may be inferred as differential pairs when importing the CSV
  file. This option suppresses messages related to inferring differential
  pairs.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - (Required) The file name of the CSV file to be imported.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the tool will
  search for the specified file in the current working directory and then in
  the directory from which the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example imports a CSV file into an open project:

    read_csv C/Data/pinList.csv

  The following example sets up a new IO Pin Planning project, and then
  imports the specified CSV file into it, and infers any differential pairs
  in the CSV file:

    create_project myPinPlan C:/Data/myPinPlan -part xc7v285tffg1157-1 
    set_property design_mode PinPlanning [current_fileset] 
    open_io_design -name io_1 
    read_csv C:/Data/import.csv 
    infer_diff_pairs -filetype csv C:/Data/import.csv

  Note: The design_mode property on the source fileset is what determines the
  nature of the project.
