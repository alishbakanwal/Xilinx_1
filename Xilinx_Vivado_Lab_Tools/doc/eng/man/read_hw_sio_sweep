Description:

  Read a hardware SIO sweep data directory and create a hw_sio_sweep object
  in the Hardware Manager feature of the Vivado Design Suite.

  The SIO sweep data can be written to disk using the write_hw_sio_sweep
  command, after running the sweep using the run_hw_sio_sweep command. This
  command reads the sweep directory containing multiple SIO scan data files.

  If no hw_sio_sweep object is specified, a new hw_sio_sweep object is
  created and is named sequentially following any existing hw_sio_sweep
  objects. After being read from disk, any of the SIO scans in the sweep can
  be plotted and viewed in the Vivado serial I/O analyzer by using the
  display_hw_sio_scan command.

  This command returns a hw_sio_sweep object, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <directory> - (Required) The name of the dirctory containing the SIO sweep
  data to read.

  <hw_sio_sweep> - (Optional) Specify an existing hw_sio_sweep object to read
  the scan data files of the sweep into. The hw_sio_sweep object can be
  specified by name, or as an object returned by the get_hw_sio_sweeps
  command.

Example:

  The following example reads the specified sweep directory and creates a new
  hw_sio_sweep object, then displays one of the hw_sio_scans from that sweep:

    read_hw_sio_sweep C:/Data/SWEEP_1/ 
    display_hw_sio_scan [get_hw_sio_scans {SCAN_86}]
