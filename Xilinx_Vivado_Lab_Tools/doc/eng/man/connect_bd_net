Description:

  Create a new net in the current IP Integrator subsystem design connecting
  the specified list of block diagram port and pin objects, or connect an
  existing net to the specified pins and ports.

  If the -net option is not specified, a new net is created connecting the
  listed objects. If -net is used, the specified net is either connected or
  created as needed.

  Use the get_bd_ports and get_bd_pins commands to specify the port and pin
  objects to connect.

  You can use this command to connect pins or ports at different levels of
  the subsystem design hierarchy. However, in this case, you cannot specify
  the -net option because the connection, when complete, will result in
  multiple nets rather than a single net.

  The command returns the connected IP Integrator subsystem design net
  object, or returns an error.

Arguments:

  -net <arg> - (Optional) Create a single net in the current IP subsystem
  design.

  Note: The -net argument is optional. When the objects being connected are
  not in the same level of hierarchy, the net argument should not be
  specified.

  -boundary_type [ lower | upper | both ] - (Optional) Specifies the search
  area for making a connection to a pin of an hierarchical block. The default
  of both searches the current level of the block design hierarchy, and
  downward, to find connecting objects. Specify upper to search only the
  current level of hierarchy, specify lower to search from the bottom of the
  hierarchy upward.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <objects> - Connect the specified list of port and pin objects in the
  current IP Integrator subsystem design.

Examples:

  The following example connects two pins on different levels of the IP
  subsystem design hierarchy:

    connect_bd_net [get_bd_pins /vidOut_1/locked] \ 
       [get_bd_pins /newMod1/bridge_1/fid]

  Note: Because /vidOut_1/locked and /newMod1/bridge_1/fid are in different
  levels of the subsystem design hierarchy, the -net option is not specified.
  In this case, multiple nets are created for connection across the
  hierarchy.
