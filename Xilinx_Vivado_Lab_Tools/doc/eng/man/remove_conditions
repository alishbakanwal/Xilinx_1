Description:

  Remove specified conditions from the current simulation. You must have an
  open simulation to use this command.

  Conditions can be defined prior to starting the simulation. When a
  condition is added, the simulator evaluates the condition expression
  anytime a signal change is detected. When a specified condition expression
  becomes TRUE, the condition commands are run.

  The conditions in the current simulation can be reported using the
  report_conditions command.

  This command returns nothing, or an error if the command fails.

Arguments:

  -all - (Optional) Remove all conditions in the current simulation.

  Note: This option will remove ALL conditions without warning, even if other
  options are specified.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <ConditionObjs> - Specifies one or more condition identifiers to remove
  from the current simulation. The condition identifiers are returned by the
  add_condition command when the condition is defined.

Examples:

  The following example removes the specified condition from the current
  simulation:

    remove_conditions condition3
