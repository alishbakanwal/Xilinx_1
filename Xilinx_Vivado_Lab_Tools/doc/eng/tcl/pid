pid(n)                Tcl Built-In Commands                pid(n)



_________________________________________________________________

NAME
       pid - Retrieve process identifiers

SYNOPSIS
       pid ?fileId?
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       If  the  fileId  argument is given then it should normally
       refer to a process pipeline created with the open command.
       In this case the pid command will return a list whose ele-
       ments are the process identifiers of all the processes  in
       the  pipeline, in order.  The list will be empty if fileId
       refers to an open file that is not a process pipeline.  If
       no  fileId  argument is given then pid returns the process
       identifier of the current process.   All  process  identi-
       fiers are returned as decimal strings.

EXAMPLE
       Print   process  information  about  the  processes  in  a
       pipeline using the SysV ps program before reading the out-
       put of that pipeline:

              set pipeline [open "| zcat somefile.gz | grep foobar | sort -u"]
              # Print process information
              exec ps -fp [pid $pipeline] >@stdout
              # Print a separator and then the output of the pipeline
              puts [string repeat - 70]
              puts [read $pipeline]
              close $pipeline
