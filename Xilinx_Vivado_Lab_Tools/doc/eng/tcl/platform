DESCRIPTION
       The platform package  provides  several  utility  commands
       useful  for  the  identification  of the architecture of a
       machine running Tcl.

       Whilst Tcl provides the tcl_platform array for identifying
       the  current architecture (in particular, the platform and
       machine elements) this is not always sufficient.  This  is
       because  (on Unix machines) tcl_platform reflects the val-
       ues returned by the uname command and these are not  stan-
       dardized  across platforms and architectures. In addition,
       on at least one platform (AIX)  the  tcl_platform(machine)
       contains the CPU serial number.

       Consequently,  individual  applications need to manipulate
       the values in tcl_platform (along with the output of  sys-
       tem  specific  utilities) - which is both inconvenient for
       developers, and introduces the potential for  inconsisten-
       cies  in  identifying  architectures and in naming conven-
       tions.

       The platform package prevents such fragmentation  -  i.e.,
       it  establishes a standard naming convention for architec-
       tures running Tcl and makes it more convenient for  devel-
       opers  to  identify the current architecture a Tcl program
       is running on.

COMMANDS
       platform::identify
              This command returns an identifier  describing  the
              platform  the  Tcl core is running on. The returned
              identifier has the general format  OS-CPU.  The  OS
              part  of  the  identifier  may contain details like
              kernel version, libc version, etc., and this infor-
              mation  may  contain  dashes as well.  The CPU part
              will not contain dashes, making the preceding  dash
              the last dash in the result.

       platform::generic
              This   command   returns  a  simplified  identifier
              describing the platform the Tcl core is running on.
              In  contrast  to  platform::identify  it leaves out
              details like kernel version, libc version, etc. The
              returned  identifier has the general format OS-CPU.

       platform::patterns  identifier
              This command takes an  identifier  as  returned  by
              platform::identify    and   returns   a   list   of
              identifiers describing compatible architectures.
